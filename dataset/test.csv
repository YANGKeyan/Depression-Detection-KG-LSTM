0,"At this point just genuinely curious what sort of shit 2020 throws my way : It's actually funny. I used to end every previous year with ""Okay, that was bad, but surely it can't get much worse!! You can only go up from rock bottom!1!!11!"", only to get fucked in the most unimaginable ways by the next year, to the point where I've mostly dissociated from my own existence and it's nothing more than a bad fucking movie. I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations! So what will it be this time? Homelessness? Another chronic illness? Or perhaps my family finally disowns me? Stay tuned!",0
1,"I have literally tried everything.... : I'm still f&amp;\*ked....never get a drop of 'good news'.....nadda.  'Oh, you're so smart (sure - went to uni - fat lot of good it did me - I'm basically unemployed because of bi-polar and have huge debt), talented (oh yeah?  so why does no one buy my sh\*t?!), pretty (okay - so, why in a joke relationship, no kids, no house then?)'.  Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up. Happy f&amp;\*king 2020....I hope it's my last and I finally just suck it up and pull the noose tight enough this time, or push the blade deep enough.....but I'm also thinking Carbon Monoxide - my car already stinks of fumes, &amp; I was told didn't 'need' catalytic converter ie. would help fix problem 'easier' too remove....got thinking.....'yes, take it off'. ;) That will be my request next time I can afford to take car in.  I'm already cleaning my car in prep.  Don't want to be 'found' in a messy car.  :)",0
2,"I'm really struggling : So I don't know how to start things like this, So I'll start with basics. I'm 16yo, diagnosed depression at 14yo. Since then, my life is total mess. I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, ""well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid"", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my ""Attention whore"" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.(Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning)",0
3,"My meds aren't making my depression any better as of late. I don't know what to do. : Depression/ PTSD / OCD / panic disorderCurrently at 15mg/day. 20 made me too sleepy and 10 wasn't enough, so I take three 5mg pills. Depression is better. Anxiety is way better (couldn't leave my house or hold a full time job prior to lexapro). This Med has been in a blessing in that I'm married and have an actual career. Problems are the following:- I am apathetic AF. I'm a musician and I never have the motivation to play my instruments anymore. I just lay on my couch. I can't go out and do social things. It's not because I'm anxious. I just feel lazy. I feel like my life is wasting away because I'm not enjoying all the things I love. - I've gained about 40lbs and I'm tired ALL the damn time. I have fibromyalgia which also makes me tired so the combo destroys my motivation to get up and move. -  Sex drive is so wonky. Cannot orgasm via sex. Takes forever to orgasm on my own. This is super frustrating! As my dose as increased this has become an issue for me. I'm afraid I've I take myself off the lexapro my depression and panic will destroy my marriage and career. I don't have great psychiatrists by me who take my insurance so my primary doctor prescribes my lexapro. Last year he floated around the idea of adding Wellbutrin but I was afraid to do so since Wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety.",0

5,"I'm not alone, and I feel it : Im going into 2020 feeling alone and lonely.  But im not,  I have a girlfriend who loves me a lot . I know She cherishes me but im sat there alone and feeling alone. how do I feel  this bad and alone when I'm also not?I have a good and bad relationship with alcohol. Im disabled with mental and neurological health problems. I have lots of feelings/numbness in my legs, neck, fingers, arms etc. Pretty much almost every where. I've probably been drunk 3 times in 2019 and each time I'm felt stronger. A lot stronger. My psychologist even reccomend having whiskey before bed because it's reduced the anxiety and adrenalin.  Sine my teen years I've been a cynical person.  Bit I dont  want to be.im a nice person and that is who I want to be. But as soon as as I have strong alcohol,  my negative emotions leave me and I feel so much better. At some points ive been been able to walk again because if it. My illness started after a car crash in 2012. And 6 months later I started feeling weak. Then i got worse and worseto ther punt I was scared to walk and so anxious I couldn't get out of bed  Since then ive slowly becomes the person I am today. In a wheelchair,  can barely lift my arms, symptoms that bad point I cant keep ny head and neck up. I have to use a neck pillow,  hoodie or scarf to feel comfortable.  I dont know what's happening to me.  Every year I get worse. But what I do know is, even before I got ill,  was I craved attention and now its gotten worse  I suppose I'm asking about 2 things. Why do I feel so lonely when I drink but why do I feel better as a person? It's m it seems my emotions conflict either way",0
6,"Help. : I'm 24 and I'm useless, I have studies in programming and sadly had been fairly smart through my life, but it does not even matter. It's only make my family expect me to be great which I never had any idea how to be. Right now I feel I'm unbelievably stupid. I don't have dreams, I dont have aspirations, I dont want anything, I just want to not wake up and sleep forever one day. I've tried to kill myself several times, I'm a failure even in that. I can't find a job, please help. All I wish is to be away from here, I wish I could leave this house filled with monsters that have only killed every one of my dreams during my whole life. By the end of school I suffered so much to choose a career because I really didn't want to do anything, I don't long for anything. The last straw was pulled long ago, but I'm so god damn weak, I have nobody, everyone I ever had eventually leaves me and I can't blame them.They make themselves look like the perfect family, like perfect parents, but I'm their venting machine. Why can't I just cease to exist if I'll be living like this. Why should I keep going, I've had fun working before until they start to rant how little I make until it makes me want to quit just to be told how dissapointed they are that I left another job just to do nothing but look for jobs.I can't take another year of this. Their families are as toxic as they are. I've read every person saying ""It'll be fine"" Or ""Just give it time"" but I'm out of it. I'll be 25 this 4th, jobless again and constantly wanting to just not wake up the next day. I don't want presents or encouraging lies. I just want to sleep forever.Sorry for this rant, sorry if some things didn't make sense, but I had to take it out of me or I would've crossed a line.",0
7,I feel like shit : I feel like shit. I've cried non stop for the past 5 days. Not sure what's going on. Ever since my 16th birthday a month ago everything has gone downhill.

I know family is supposed to be with you through hard times. I had an amazing boyfriend who supported me through everything, they took him away too. He's about to leave me. I was about to go on a vacation with him and on the last day my sister said I can't go and threatened me that she'll call the police and my mom pretended to have a heart attack and it ended up being just gastric and she was discharged in a day. So many fake people around me. They took my only happiness away from him, my boyfriend lost a lot of money on the booking of the vacation and he's mad at me. I can't blame him, he can't be mad at my family so he's mad at me. I lost everything in a day. My family would let a sexual molester in the house who raped me but couldn't let me go with a man I've been with for 5 years.

I'm scared of death. A part of me wants to live, I want to get help but they're not sending me to a psychiatrist because they think depression is an abnormality, they want to be a perfect kid who marches to their drums and don't feel anything.

I really just want to sit at home and sleep. Also, my habits are really fucked! I don't really get hungry or tired, so I eat about 1 meal a day which my parents tell me to eat.

I'm overly emotional. I feel way too much. When I'm sad or upset I literally become sick to my stomach and my heart feels like it's being stabbed over and over with a fucking jackknife. It was the worst tonight because there was alcohol everywhere and it triggered me but luckily I didn't. I shouldn't due to health issues and medications but it doesn't stop be from still drinking and becoming a dick. I'm the worst person while under the influence. I become angry and hateful. So it's either I isolate myself because I'm a delicate flower that needs to be protected or I damage my reputation by drinking to numb the pain and being a dick to everyone around me. I wish I didn't ruin everything. I wish I didn't fuck up with everyone I care about. I make terrible decisions. I fell madly in love with someone but I still managed to somehow damage his trust with me. I make myself hard to love. I'm not sure if I can recover from this. Am I simply a horrible person? or is this just mental illness? Either way it feels like literal HELL I'm weak and not strong enough for this life everything is so fucked up and I hate everyone and everything I don't understand why anything operates the way it does I wish everything was different I wish I didn't have to shut my brain off on purpose every day because I can't stop myself from all the irrational thoughts",0

Forcing themselves to spend time with people they dont even talk to for the rest of the year and spending money on them and they end up in debt. It's all idiotic. As for me, the next decade brings even more misery. I'm only going to get older and its already impossible for me to get my life together. I'm uneducated and with all the talks of autonomy, it's going to be likely that any job I get will be replaced. I'm so broke that I cant even get out of a 3k debt and I'll have to ask my parents to pay off my car in a few years so I can keep it to go to my dead end jobs that make me little to nothing. I dont have money to go back to school or the emotional strength since right now my mom has cancer and my dad is abusive. I'm so depressed and have so much anxiety that by the end of the day I have to do stretches to fix my posture. I hate interacting with people so my head is dipped so low by the end of everyday. I've seen so many therapists and been on many medications. Nothing really works. Sometimes I feel a little less bad but I'm just numb.

50,"My problem. : I know i sound so fucking egotistic in this text, butno. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empatheticz to the point that it actually hurts me. Ill just get straight into it. My dad tried to commit suicide back in the summer of 2012 when i was only 10. He fortunately survived and got help. He is still alive to this day and from what i know, he is happier than ever. However, when my dad tried to commit suicide 7 years ago, i blamed no one but myself for my dads suicide attempt. And i guess its pretty normal for a 10 yr to blame themselves when something similar happens. The thing is, even though i know it wasnt my fault and even though i know hes better now, it still scarred me in a wierd way. My problem that i have now and have had for 7 years is: I always think someone is sad or depressed. It doesnt matter how small it is, it could be that i see my dad sitting in the livingroom by himself doin nothing because everyone else is doin their own shit completely ignoring him. Then i have to go to him and sit there just so tjat he doesnt feel alone. And i realize tjat i dont even know if he feels alone. Maybe he wanta to just be by himself? I know this, but it doesnt matter. My mind will always be that way even thoigh i know.But i cannot not sit next to him either becuase then this thought in my head that he or anyone else in the same position might hurt themselves because they feel lonely or any fucking bullshit my mind has decided to turn on.things that disturbs me every day:â?Seeing someone sit aloneâ?Seeing someone being left outâ?Hearing someone say to someone that the food (could be anything like that, doesent have to be food) they made was badâ?seeing someone cryingâ?when my friends get left out but i csnt do anything about itâ?seeing someone being sad in generalAll of these things and more disturbs me on a daily basis and it affects me so much that i just sit in a corner and feel bad for other people that doesnt even think about it. So basically, even if they dont feel like something bad has hapoened to them, i cant help but to feel super bad.I never tell anyone what i actually want if i think its going to hurt them. If i tell my dad that i want to live at my mothers place a bit more or vice versa one of them will be sad and i will have to see them be sad. Ive never been honest about what i truly want (because i think will hurt someone) There is nothing i hate more than seeing other people sad. And now because of this fucking thing that happened to my dad 7 years ago that made me think everyone is sad, i cant stand it.I truly believe that this came from my dads suicide attempt. Im not blaming him for it, i would never. I know i sound so fucking egotistic like ""oh im sooo empathitic and caring"" No. Thats not what im saying at all. My point is that am WAY TO empathetic, so empathetic that it sometimes hurt me so badly seeing someone else sad that i want to seriously hide under my cover and do nothing but cry because other people are sad, and then never leave the bed again. This is so hard to explain. I fully get it if none of you understand wtf im writing about because its so messy, but i seriously find it so hard to describe this.Also english isnt my first language so if have messed up the grammar or something somewhere you know why",0

59,"Going in and out of happy and depressed. : I feel like this has always been a thing with me.

I'll realize something in my head and go ""why it's so easy to feel happy in this situation, i think i've found the secret"" then 20 min later i'll feel so hopeless and depressed telling myself I was a fool to think the solution would be so simple and easy. This will happen to me throughout the day. It gets even worse when I feel the need to control my anxiety, and when I do I get anxiety on how I'm not doing good enough at controlling my anxiety. Then I tell myself to just let it go and accept being out of control, but even then my brain starts doubting my ability to accept being out of control, and i get even more anxiety. I just feel like I'm in running in loops throughout the day. Was wondering if this is similar to anyone else. I have ADHD-C so I feel it might be related to my constantly running mind.",0

61,"Do these count as suicidal feelings and should I bring them up to my doctor? (Trigger Warning) : Do any of the following situations count as far as answering the question âHow often do you feel suicidal/have thoughts of harming yourself?â?Because in my depression I've definitely had times where the idea of dying actually sounded nice. I don't feel that way anymore, despite the following scenarios. But even in my darkest moments, I never came up with a plan, not even in the moments when I really wanted to die and I trust myself that I am NEVER going to act on any feelings in this area I may have and that if I was afraid I was going to that I would seek emergency care. Going to get a mental health assessment soon so just wondering! Most of these happen during mood dips which usually last less than an hour. 1. SITUATION 1: CURRENT SITUATION, happens a few times a week at least and frequently if I'm low. Random intrusive suicidal thoughts, for example let's say I'm feeling depressed (sometimes these happen when I'm not distinctly depressed as well although it could be a mixed mood I suppose) and I am washing a kitchen knife. My brain goes, âYou could use that to kill yourself.â?The rational part of my brain steps in and is like, âNo, you're not going to do that. That's stupid.â?2. SITUATION 2: CURRENT SITUATION, happens as often as Situation 1. The same as Situation 1 except that the feelings aren't randomly triggered by handling or seeing a potentially lethal object but when something goes wrong. Example: my favorite person reads but doesn't reply to my text. This causes a mental breakdown where I'm incredibly anxious, I'm convinced they hate me, and I'm also convinced I'm the worst person ever born and all my usual self esteem vanishes. My brain goes âOkay, guess you should just kill yourself then.â?But the rational part is like âNO YOU DON'T. THAT IS STUPID.â?Sometimes this situation ends up being a combination between Situation 2 and Situation 3. 3. SITUATION 3: CURRENT SITUATION, happens probably once a week? I am having a mood dip. I am feeling intensely depressed. I find myself fantasizing about hurting myself, perhaps also with intrusive thoughts about how it could be done. I do not have any plan for suicide. I don't have a method picked out or any plans whatsoever to act on my feelings. Despite the fact that emotionally, I think I want to die, the rational part of my brain is aware that I DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DIE. If someone were to come up to me and tell me that within 5 minutes I was going to die in a freak accident without me having to do anything violent towards myself, I would be DEVASTATED because I do not ACTUALLY want to die. I really want to live and feel better and I have a ton of hope for my future, goals, can see the future being good, etc. The rational part of my brain is aware during these feelings that I only think I want to die because my emotions are too overwhelming to deal with and my brain is dumb and thinks suicide is the best solution. Again, I do not have even any plans whatsoever to act on those feelings and I do not actually want to die. I also trust that if I did want to actually kill myself that I would reach out to someone or call 911 because again, deep down I do not want to die and I want to live. 4. SITUATION 4: PAST SITUATION. This has happened in the past but very rarely now. Example 1: Grabbing a bottle of ibuprofen to take ONE for a headache while depressed but not even being able to take one because you're aware the impulse to take all of them will be too strong if you take any. Example 2: Not being able to shave in the shower sometimes before because I was aware the urge to cut myself would be too strong. In both situations, I had enough impulse control to not put myself in a potentially dangerous situation. Which of those count as âthoughts of suicideâ?or whatever my doctor might ask? If I bring these things up to my doctor and explain I experience them generally at least once a week but make it very clear that I am not in any actual danger of harming myself and that I don't want to die, am I in any danger of getting hospitalized? Should I make the above things sound like I don't experience them now but did in the past and if so, how far back in the past is safe to say?Chances are I wouldn't be feeling suicidal the actual day of my appointment so I could honestly say ânoâ?if asked if I was currently suicidal because usually those feelings only happen during mood dips which usually don't last terribly long for me. I live in Florida in case that matters.Thank you so much!",0

76,"Feeling like I don't have reasons to be depressed : I was overthinking a little. I've been diagnosed with bipolar depression a couple of years ago, but I remember having it (or at least being a big melancholic) my whole life, and I somehow don't feel like I have ""enough reasons"" to be depressed.I see so many people having their depression triggered or caused by major tragic events in their lifes like truly having a difficult and shitty life with family, school and even addictions issues; but in my case (or at least most of it) I get very depressed due to romantic issues. I think that the most recurrent event in my life is loving some girl and not being corresponded and, in most cases, having to see her with someone else. In front of all of this I feel so diminished, like it isn't a valid reason to be like this. I get so bad, like really suicidal, sometimes and I feel dumb by thinking that if someone asked me ""But you wanna kill yourself because of that girl?"" I'd promptly would say yes.Of course, it isn't solely this that makes me miserable. There are truly other aspects of my life that sadden me a lot, but specially the romantic one have such a huge toll on me. I feel so unwanted and unimportant, ignored and even blame myself a lot for thinking it's my fault the other person don't feel the same, and for putting myself into some situations I see myself as a fool.For me is so hard being alone. Unfortunately, many of the friendships I have with girls exist because in some point I was interested in some way, and I feel bad that nothing came out of it. I don't like to get too intimal with people I don't know, and it's really hard to get romantically involved with friends because they're insecure it will ruin the friendship or even because of being seen as a brother or only as a friend. I know I'm wrong acting like this. I'd be a little more comfortable and feel less unwanted if only some kind of caress happened, a kiss, of even sex in some cases. But, well, with so many people having ""worst"" issues, I feel like this is nothing and that I'm dumb for letting this kind of thing take me down.&amp;#x200B;Any thoughts?It's my first time posting here, and idk, was just feeling like letting it out.

77,"I never feel like I'm doing enough and I'm worried I'm going to be a failure. : I'm a 20 year old guy working about 25-35 hours a week for minimum wage in food services. I'm going to school full time and have a pretty solid gpa. My plan is to become a highschool teacher and I'm making decent progress towards it. This is about the only thing that I can tell myself for reassurance when I really start to feel down though. Still, it will take me 4 years (1 1/2 more) of community college to get the associates and the 90 units I need for subbing and an additional 3 years to become a teacher, and I feel like that makes me seem weak. Especially since you're supposed to get that associates degree in 2 years. Now to explain the insecurities I have, I guess ill start with my weight. I think being a fat kid really messes with your development. Not just because kids constantly tease you but it literally caused my hormones to go out of whack and give me high estrogen in highschool. I lost 100 pounds before my senior year and I'm still chubby 3 years down the road. I just cant stick to a exercise and diet regimen for very long. I'm about 30 pounds overweight with probably 20 of those pounds being fat. I do go running up hills and/or do bodyweight circuits and burn around 600 additional calories a day. Still I offset this by eating 2800 calories or more every day. With all that's going on in my life I wish I could just accept my current weight and say I'm healthy, but I'm not that attractive because of it. I have a lot of weight on my stomach and I have a bit of female breast tissue that makes me look feminine with my shirt off. My body makes me cringe when I look at it and I constantly am thinking about how gross I probably look. With all the other shit going on in my life I just cant set aside more than the 2 hours a day I already put into my body and the food addiction has actually improved from when I was a kid and would eat 4000 calories a day. I'm hungry 24/7 and it hurts when people tell me I just need to stop being lazy and get into shape upon bringing this up. As far as my face goes, I'm like an average 7/10 or so. I can't really complain about it even though I could look a lot nicer. I am told I look like a 16 year old a lot.Another huge insecurity of mine is having a small penis. It's right under 5 inches with girth on the low end of average and I worry it will severely limit the girls that will be willing to have a relationship with me. I know everyone is different, I just hope that the girls I'm attracted to dont end up being the type to care so much. The combination of extra weight, female breast tissue, a bit of a baby face, and being 6'0 tall make me feel like an awkward teenager still and my body just wont grow out of it. As far as hobbies go I play guitar regularly and I do slowly achieve goals I set for it. Still, I dont have the time to put into it to become a professional level musician even though my theory knowledge is close to it. I used to be really good at piano but I stopped playing when my mom died. Music in general is the only reason I'm still alive as corny as that sounds. It's my favorite part of the human experience and one of the closest things we have to magic. Although guitar can do a good job distracting me, I dont feel fulfilled when practicing in my room. In highschool I was a heavy drug user for about 10 months of my life. I can't say for sure, but I theorize that I did a lot of damage to my mental development by taking xanax, opiates, and muscle relaxers damn near every day and often at the same time, washing them down with alcohol or codeine cough syrup. I was so depressed back then and my parents being old fashioned, didn't believe in depression. I self medicated and self-destructed for a while until something interesting happened. I asked the girl of my dreams out and she rejected me. My initial urge was to commit suicide but somehow rationality stepped in and I just threw away the drugs and set out to improve myself. I lost 70 pounds in 4 months and came back to my senior year completely different and clean except for marijuana. I think I wanted to prove her wrong about me because in my mind I was pretty sure she just thought i was a loser. Eventually i ended up experimenting with psychedelics which sadly gave me PTSD for about a year. I was believing in spiritual forces and extra sensory perceptive abilities because I was having flashbacks from the massive doses of LSD I had done. It took me a long time to figure out that it was my amygdala giving me flashbacks and that i wasnt seeing into some higher dimension and it really fucked me up to be borderline psychotic for all that time. At this point I've never been even slightly romantically involved with a girl even though many have been interested in me. I have strong requirements that any girl I date be a potential candidate for marriage even if she isnt necessarily the girl I end up marrying. Why would I date someone who I know my relationship wont work out with? One girl initially seemed great, but as we talked more, I realized her values were different from mine and that's the closest I've been to being in a relationship. Most girls, it only takes a few weeks of knowing them to rule them out. I find my situation to be additionally complicated by the fact that I like conservative minded women, but I'm not christian and not exactly conservative. I have bounced back and forth on the political spectrum until deciding the best result would be of compromise and unity, meeting in the middle. A decrease of radical ideas rather than a swing in either direction seems to be a philosophy that can be applied at multiple levels of life. A lot of college girls are crazy liberal and having tons of sex with different guys, not planning for the future, going to festivals etc... I wouldn't set myself up for failure with these types who are the opposite of the christian girls. I want to meet someone who is a good compliment to me, that would build me up and be a positive force in my life , but who also isnt trapped by dogma and institutional fears. I think I'm a very exceptional person. Which doesn't mean I'm great but that I fall under many exceptions both very good and very bad. This seems to make it harder to find people who i really connect with on a deep level even though superficially connecting with people is something I'm quite adept at, especially for an introvert. I write all of this out of loneliness and fear. I want to have someone to show affection to and to recieve affection from, and I'm worried that my inadequacies and my past and my odd perspective will ultimately lead me to becoming a failure who no one good wants to be around. I know I might be building a slippery slope here but this feeling gnaws at me constantly. Along with occasional paranoia and panic, and sometimes I just go completely numb. You see, I have really bad depression but I try not to let it define me and I dont like thinking that every word that comes out of my mouth is the result of a mental illness. So I've laid on the table so much of what bothers me on a daily basis and then decided to reveal that yes, I am depressed and I am also a human being who wants to feel like they are more than a diagnosis.",0
78,"Question about coming off meds (cymbalta) : Hey just wanted to know if someone in the same boat could offer some advice. Long story short I'm depressed and a little bit anxious and have been on cymbalta the last 3 or 4 years. On 90mg a day for a while then I did a lot of work on myself last year and lost some weight and dropped to 60 and then in November to 30mg (all this was discussed with my psychiatrist btw).So I saw him maybe 3 weeks ago and we decided to try coming off entirely. So for the first week I was taking one every other day but now haven't had one for maybe 5 days.And so that's the backstory, but my questions are about side effects from coming off them. I just feel really down and emotional at the moment. And I'm really hoping it's just a temporary thing as I get used to not having meds, and that this isn't just what I am like off the meds entirely :/ Specifically I just feel really sad and down and lack of energy but not like sleepy. It's more of a sadness then just depressed. And a little bit of anxiety. I suppose it doesn't help that cause of the holidays I've been drinking a bit and eating really unhealthily. But anyway I gues the main question is - is it normal to feel this way when coming off antidepressants and is it just temporary? Has anyone else come off cymbalta - what was it like for you?",0
79,"Reaching my breaking point. Again. : I have bipolar disorder type two and CPTSD from childhood trauma, and from being in a severely abusive relationship. I was raped in 2018 and re-traumatised. I was on sickleave for a year. I'm a computer scientist and landed my first job in 2017, at the age of 31 (finished my degree when I was 29). For years I was depressed because I didn't have any money and couldn't support myself financially. I was at my breaking point. Until I magically actually got a job.I enjoyed my job. A lot. It gave me purpose and a sense of accomplishment. Then 2018 happened and I couldn't even go outside without having a panic attack and I ended up on sickleave while I was in therapy. Which lasted a year.  During this time, the thought of being a burden on my colleagues was contributing to my depression. I was happy to get back to work, but I was also a bit worried. But it worked out well for 5 months,  even though a particular coworker was being toxic and I had fallen behind and couldn't quite catch up. But I kept trying.Then last month, my grandmother died. And I don't know why but it triggered my depression. I have to commute by train to work and every day I had to resist the urge to jump on the tracks. I went to work 2 hours early just so I could cry by my desk. I wanted to jab a pen into my arm to injure myself. I had a complete meltdown when a coworker casually asked me ""How's it going?"". So I ended up on sickleave again throughout december while I sorted out meds with my doctor. I started feeling better and I was excited to get back to work and maybe regain a sense of purpose.I was supposed to work on the 30th of december, but I logged into our portal and saw that no one was working. And there weren't any tasks I could do, so there wasn't any point of me going to work (we can do this. Saving up overtime hours and then use those hours to take time off). I didn't notify my boss like I'm supposed to do because he was on vacation.   I had turned off text message notifications because of my depression so I didn't see that he had texted me. He called me around noon on the 31th to... basically yell at me. He said things like ""You can't keep doing this"" (it's the first time it's happened), and ""any more sickleave incoming?"" (how am I supposed to know?) and ""You HAVE to go to work on thursday"" (well duh? I don't have vacation?). But because of trauma I went into trauma-mode and couldn't stand up for myself or explain. I made an honest mistake that I could have explained, and I could have stood up for myself and answer him in the way I wrote in the paranthesis, but I turned into a child that was being scolded.Yesterday I started researching the equipment I need to kill myself. I started drafting suicide notes in my head. I'm going to the doctor today (I bet the boss is going to yell at me for that too) and it's currently 7 am and I'm crying and want to die. I have no idea if I'm able to work. I have no idea if I can deal with the sight of train tracks again. I think I'm going to have to go on sickleave again. But then my boss will hate me even more. Going to explain the situation to my doctor and see if he has any advice. I'm currently not in therapy but I'm going ask my doctor to hook me up with a therapist.Life has no meaning or purpose. I don't know what to do.I don't know why I'm writing this but thanks for reading :(",0

81,"Happy fucking new year : I've been struggling with a major depressive episode since about 2014. Not my first, but maybe the worst since my first in 1989 when I made my first (pathetically failed) suicide attempt. For most of the next 4 years I hid it - apparently successfully - until a dissociation crisis in Dec 2018 scared me enough to take another chance on the local mental health system despite the significant risk their antiquated attitudes to mental illness would cost me my job and maybe my family.A few months later, I finally told my wife, who is local, and was treated to a lecture about how I'm weak, how everyone has problems, how I was stupid to let the doctors ""trick"" me into taking pills when all I needed was good friends and a hobby. I brushed it off, and worked it anyway. This time last year I was in full remission and came off the meds. And I was doimg great, feeling more like *me* than I had in decades. But the weeks became months, and the months added up, and by the time summer came I was painfully aware of how disconnected we were. Some of that is definitely due to my depression - the sour moods, the pulling away - but more was because she had just refocused in ways that excluded me from her life. And when I look back, I realised that half my problem had been that when things were worst I no longer felt safe reaching out to her. In August I started slipping again, in October I needed to gp back on meds, by the end of November my doctprs gave me anti-psychotics - just in case the urge to self-harm or suicide got too much to manage.An now it's a New Year. I had a long break over Christmas so I wanted to visit family and friends back home. She and the kids didn't come. And it's been so good. The enthusiasm and love from friends and family is incredible. I haven't felt so loved and wanted in so long. That's a problem. Today I realised that depression has killed my marriage. I don't know how we can get back from here, but I know the sense of isolation and the lack of partnership is a big part of why I relapsed. Getting bavk might literally be impossible. And now I'm stuck with an impossible decision on top of already having days when I really, really wish it would all just end.",0

I'm also very demotivated, I'm not excited to be getting older because it makes me incredibly anxious, and I feel like I've wasted my entire life chasing things I'm not good at. My family is well-off. I, personally, am not, and while they don't resent me for not holding down a job (I'm just working part-time while being a full-time student), I can feel the disappointment and the burden of expectations piling on. I don't feel happy about life anymore. I can't see my future and frankly, I don't want to. I feel stupid, mentally degraded, emotionally stunted. I've been on meds for three years, and while there's been a difference, I don't think I've been able to address the core issues.I hold on because of the little things. Pets and hobbies, mostly.

They'll be a party with free food free weed and drinks and my dumbass would rather sleep in. I haven't been able to truly live my young years and it makes me sad because I know I'll regret it in the future. Also I got into abusive relationships back to back so I wasted 3 years on those.

84,"I was messed up bad over what I lost in 2015 (for four + years), and now 2019 is a new nightmare... : I got diagnosed with P.T.S.D. this last year, and though I already knew what I was experiencing, I think that it all unknowingly to me became a lot, lot worse this past year...My P.T.S.D is slightly centered around bad incidents, yes, but they are from so far back in this life now and I am thick skinned and tough, and I can take it, but where this ""P.T.S.D."" is really getting to me hard is in moments of happiness not cherished, not even realized. Precious moments lost and opportunities discarded are eating away at my soul like you would not believe. Music, imagery, sounds, smells, so many visuals, feels, everything is taking me back to this past year...I... I'm going to start fuckin' crying like a baby because this is the first time I've actually come out and said this blatantly without being vague on here with my posts...You know that feel after a breakup when you know that you're unstable and you cling on and hang on to an image, an attachment of someone? And yet...deep down, you know but don't want to admit to yourself just yet that you do know that they aren't the one? You know how your mind is secretly racing over the ""grass is greener"" thoughts of a new love that will come along? Maybe you're right back on Craigslist or here, or wherever, to just find that immediate relief, someone to talk to...and it all hurts... The time getting through a loss like that hurts, but you do it..?...When they say ""You'll know,"" they really mean it...I knew in 2015 that, while I started dating a girl I truly loved and thought was great, I left behind my Soulmate... ...It was a girl whom I met right at the very moment I stopped believing in such things. I ran from her because I thought I saw red flags--my own red flags--where I was about to fall back into an instability of mine to believe in such things...She just stood out......Long story short: I left her behind... I broke her heard. I thought about her for the next four years and killed my relationship/friendship with the other girl I loved... We broke up just over a year ago, and I waited to let myself calm slightly before going back to find that girl I left behind...I was numb from a lot of past trauma to have cut my emotions off to begin with regarding love and especially true-love, but in the last four years, I experienced even more trauma...a lot of it... I won't list it here, but it was trauma of many different types.I started dating my Soulmate at the beginning of 2019, and I took her for granted...I was so lost that I didn't recognize anything in my life as being ephemeral or breakable or anything... I just.. I was dead inside. I couldn't lift a finger to do anything... I thought I was stable, and that's why I came back into her life, and as soon as I saw her face, just as in 2015, I fell apart... When she is around, the air is electric. It's on fire. I can't explain it. All I know is that she is the catalyst... ..She told me she loved me far before I did in 2015. She used the term Soulmate first. I was terrified. I knew how I reacted to losing loves far less than her...and I didn't want to imagine the possibility of losing her...I lost her...Not forever, I dearly hope. This isn't the normal ""break"" relationships take when they truly intend to breakup. ..This is...powerful.. She's sometimes on the other side of the world when it comes to us communicating through our anxieties, but it's never been a problem for us because when it comes to this electric love, we are on the same page, always... We are tethered... I've never heard anyone speak so strongly before about what we share. I'm not worried about it--the love itself--for that is something that can't be broken. What I'm worried about is myself... I'm worried about her... I'm worried about an uncertain future. ..We both struggle with depression more than you could believe.. We have a pact to keep each other in this world. I can't keep writing this.I don't know where I was going with this.I don't know.I can't do therapists. I can't talk to some empty, emotionless human who does it for a job. I just can't. Everyone here is faceless, behind a screen, and for someone as antisocial and distrusting as me, that is the most beautiful kind of human connection. To just see kind words here...I'm in a bad place, people... I'm really in a bad place... I miss her. I am not like this often. I have an unhealthy pride that does not allow me to show myself like this, and yet here I am. I'll even admit that I've just started crying, and I am trying so hard to force these tears back inside....When you meet that person, you just know...And it isn't rainbows and butterflies, people... Don't envy this... If you have anxiety and depression, don't envy this... It is so fucking terrifying to find the one you love and know that the both of you are not immortal but in fact very, very mortal... You begin to realize how fragile life is and how fleeting it is... I threw away four years that I could have kept my ex as my best friend and spent more time with the girl who makes my world whole. My soul is torn in pieces and deposited in different places, different times throughout these past 5 years... Part of me is dead and still back there in 2015 during that horrible, fateful moment that I left her... I see a certain color in the night air and I crumble because it takes me back to that moment. I watch a music video for a song I love, and I see a plane fly through the sky and it takes me back to last year when she had her head against my shoulder as we flew to San Francisco for her work. I'm just so fucking broken...Inside I know... I KNOW that I will be with her again, but this has been so much time ... so much time has been wasted ......We lost our child...I have to go.I can't keep doing this. I can't keep writing.I don't do this. My pride is killing me, and I need to abandon it, but I can't be weak. I'm going to feel weak. I've had bad things happen to me when I let my shield down. I had my father when I met this girl, and he's dead now. My mother is a piece of shit. I'm sorry, but don't you dare tell me to respect her. She had police point guns at me soon after his death and she watched as they did it. She even smiled. She's barely human. She goes back and forth, and she is one of the most bipolar people I know, yet I am nothing but kind to her, and I live in much closer proximity with her now than I had ever wished to at the age of 30.Kind words... My pride is fucking killing me right now for asking this, but I just need kind words... I'm not okay... I'm not well...I will not kill myself. I can't Not as long as she is here and alive...I'm no longer crying...I've written like this before, and I've deleted it all... I'm not going to this time...I'm not comfortable with this, but maybe this is a good thing. Maybe this is a big step for me to take......I'm blocking things out... Things I've just written about, I'm blocking them out as I write this last line, and I have to. I've never been able to block things out before. Reality has always been right in my face. But it's getting so rough, that I'm beginning to block shit out.Everyone here who supports one another and loves blindly and unconditionally through this ""faceless and emotionless"" screen... I love you... I have seen people bring one another up here in ways that make me almost have hope in humanity again...And yet right around the corner, in some of these subs, people are so horrible to one another...When will we fucking learn... ..I digress.. I have enough problems of my own without getting into deep, philosophical talks...I am so uncomfortable with this. But, I'm going to post this.What a rambling mess of a post... I'll leave this up for a while, but eventually, it's going to get deleted. Or perhaps, I'll just start using a different account. Who knows.Please don't suggest medication.

85,"Coming to terms with the temporariness of it all. : My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days. For example I'm feeling fairly rubbish at the moment, but instead of the thoughts of loneliness and inadequacy I used to get with these feelings, I now just look forward to not feeling like this. It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't.

Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much. I don't want to go through any of this. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. I'm tired of being taunted by everyone and having to dodge questions about why I'm still unemployed.

87,"Venting a bit : I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it's felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism's day depression. Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the ânext pageâ?button and it brought me to the payment section.Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it's a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn't mention that until you've already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, âokay what's going on, what's wrong? Oh no that's unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I'm gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can't afford it, well fuck off then.â?It's 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn't ask for and wouldn't wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don't know where I'd be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being.

89,"Hating what I used to love : I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.",0

92,"Can I leave some baggage here : Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone",0

I have THOUGHT about killing myself but I never would because I love my pets. I don't physically self-harm either.I don't see how I'm a danger to myself or anyone else so there's no reason to get sectioned, right?",0
94,"I was told it gets better, 10 years later and it just got numb. : So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.Tl:Dr After many years, things started to look good until family trouble, now it's worse than ever.",0
95,"My family doesn't validate or accept my feelings, so I don't either. : Over the years, I've been called lazy for wanting to lie in bed, a baby for breaking down and crying, and selfish for wanting any time to myself. When they suspected that I was doing bad things to myself, I was also told that I would burn in hell for it.I was diagnosed with depression, and even the doctor didn't really seem to care. So I guess I don't either. I don't take care of myself as much as I should because I'm losing my will to change. To be better. I'm starting to think that I really am just as useless as my family thinks I am.",0
96,"I Don't Care About Living Anymore : Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I'd ever been. I don't want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn't as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I've isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I'm weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can't live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I'm all of those things, and I can't stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can't take it anymore.Right now I'm on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I'm going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There's a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don't care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It's not even that I'm suicidal. I'm not trying to kill myself. But if that's what ends up happening, I don't care. I just don't want to be here.",0

(her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.I still suffer from depression but this is how I cope, I still need post it notes on my walls to remember changing clothes, washing and shaving.",0
98,"Chronic Harm OCD sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice? : Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.",0

I used to cry myself to sleep but now I just sit for hours on end thinking and searching for a reason to live. I can't cry anymore, no matter how much I try.

If they loved me I wouldn't be in the situation I am in right now. I fake my happiness so that they don't worry about me. I build an armor around my heart to protect myself and others. I try to build a wall but it doesn't work. I just keep falling deeper and deeper into my hole. I lost, angry and I tired. Tired of being here. I don't need people to constantly check up on me.

102,"forcing myself to appreciate my progress : Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. ð¥´  Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  6) i have never missed a day of therapy  7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hourI think that's about it.

103,"I tried to kill myself yesterday and wanna quit the meds, long post : So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"".

104,"I think this is my final straw and I am scared : Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.I've started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let's see what happens.I'm a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.I first realized my teen angst wasn't just a âphaseâ?sometime in my early 20's. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I've since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that âpoetryâ?in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn't anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone's house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn't much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.When I arrived in Canada I didn't speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had âcarpet timeâ?(when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn't say anything, partly because I couldn't physically, partly because I couldn't mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren't close.)This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn't fit in with the âcool popular kids.â?Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let's call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an âinâ?with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started ârelationshipsâ?with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let's call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent's cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn't know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can't remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun âfashionâ?night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she's a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I'm not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn't matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn't want to, or couldn't break.I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn't take no for an answer even if I didn't really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven't done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn't stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven't seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor's heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I've ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn't right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I'm not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn't know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can't say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I'm moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got âback togetherâ? continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn't mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn't want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren't the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. I laughed at this. I didn't cry, I didn't feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren't right for each other.So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn't satisfy me anymore and my body can't handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can't afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can't stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. The job thing - realized I'm the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn't an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can't stay excited and motivated. Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn't find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn't show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don't know if I want to stop. I've had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I've cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I'm not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don't have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I'm finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word âIâ?is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won't lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn't felt the pull of it.Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.",0

I was forgetting where I was, who I was talking to. This horror lasted 2 hours. After I finally took Klonopin the symptoms stopped.  I'm relatively a healthy person. I will be seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is no other underling condition. Did this ever happened to you?",0
107,"I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me. : So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.",0

I know I cannot be upset with him for not understanding, but I'm also extremely frustrated about it. He says it's embarrassing to have a mom with depression. That just hurts me even more. He went from having a happy, energetic, spunky, fun, thrill seeking, supportive mom to one who lays in bed all the time, is constantly fatigued, has migraines constantly, no patience, never wants to do anything, cries a lot, etc. I feel like he's grieving me. I grieve myself, so I can understand. But he cannot. He thinks I'm just being selfish, lazy, mean, etc. I looked on Google for some ideas but didn't find anything that I felt like going with.

115,"Where will I end up if I know I can't deal with life and don't want to kill myself. : I've suffered with depression my entire life and never did much to overcome it early on when I should have.  I will turn 30 soon and I have been addicted to porn since I was 12. I used porn as a safe coping mechanism so that I wouldn't have to deal with anything in life- improving social skills and having friendships, taking risks, developing hobbies, talking to girls and dating, going to college, traveling. Ive done none of these things. I've had a few menial jobs and have an apartment. That's it.Now I have no job, I am a virgin and I have no friends. I just quit watching porn a month ago, but I am more depressed than I have ever been. This is because when I cut my coping mechanism being porn addiction out of your routine, reality hit me like a brick wall. Everything is bubbling to the surface and I am fully overwhelmed by the fact that I have completely wasted my young life. I see absolutely no positive reason to move forward. I have never felt this close to suicide being the only way out before. I am seeing shrinks about my problems and got put on meds recently this month. Therapy is not helping and you know meds just numb the pain a bit. They don't do anything to improve me without me trying to improve myself. But it's gotten to the point where I have no desire to improve myself AT ALL!! I can't get out of bed, can't eat. can't go outside. I have no passion to do anything. I know I can't commit suicide but I don't want to move or think. I've been in a crisis unit at a local hospital 5 years ago and it did nothing to help me. All they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for 2 weeks straight before they released me. All this did for me was numb the pain with medication and I was just as unhappy as I was before I went in. So my question is what happens when you don't want to kill yourself, but you can't deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? Is there a place where they will put you where you don't have to leave your bed? Psych ward or something?  I want to be put away forever. I can't deal with the uphill battle I will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. I do not have any strength left to improve myself at all. I do not want to be released from the care of others. Where do they put someone like me at his point. Any advice?",0
116,"I'm tired of fighting : I've spent years fighting against depression, ptsd, generalised anxiety disorder and an eating disorder. I've had support from the local mental health team done tons of therapy throughout the years. Medication the lot. But I still think of ending my life everyday. Sometimes it's less intense and other times it's highly intense. I've stopped talking to any family about how I feel because I get comments a lot if i do about how to effects them. Although I have a complex diagnosis I am not a person who creates toxic environments for them. It's almost as if my very existence is a reminder that they failed me as a child to protect me. I do understand it must be really hard for them. They're the only reason I havnt fully gone through with a suicide attempt because I wouldn't want to break my mums heart I know she would blame herself but I'm getting to the end of my 20s and I'm incredibly tired or feeling this way. When I try and do something just for myself it upsets someone in the family for example if I say I'm going to go out with my brother who is around my own age to go watch a band or distract myself by other siblings who chose to have families say âoh you never want to spend time with meâ?it's like nothing I do is right. I feel like I'm living for everybody else but what I really want is to just not live. I feel incredibly stuck in life i live in a box room can't afford to move out. I just stay in my room 90% of the time every night I say to myself stay in the moment be mindful tomorrow is a new day. But when I wake up it's the same feelings.

117,"Not really sure what to say kinda new to this : So I'm not super good at being open, but lately it's hard to go through a hour, especially at work without some form of crying spell. Since where I'm at the cost of getting a therapy session in takes for ever, or they want to charge a arm and a leg. Which I dont have since struggling with money since I'm the only that works currently in the family.Figured I'd try anything at this point since even though it's legal in my current state I don't want to rely on drugs for a crutch. I know they work wonders on people and people swear by it, its just not for me. Then I've gone cold turkey with alchol since I figured in this current state that also wasnt the best idea to keep it in the house. So I've been sober since last october, but the longer I live here the harder it is for me. Like it's hard to explain since in my mind, I know people are going through this with me and there are people who have it worse then me. That all dosnt seem to matter though and I cant shake it off me.I've been kinda slowly I'm depressed over the last 3 years, and it just gets harder each day, there are some good days though. Even some good weeks like went down south to look at houses, and for the week and a half I didnt have any kinda crying spell or anything. Felt like me and it was great, then came back up here and it's been really rough on me. The mood swings have been worse and I've been distancing myself from my wife, and closing myself off to the outside. All I can do is just watch and I feel helpless to do anything about it, minus just cry which I've been doing for the past hour in my office toilet.Then got to thinking maybe there is a reddit where I can kinda just talk, even if it's to myself for a little bit. I really dont know much coping skills or even methods. Which I've been looking into, and take some cbd gummies even though they dont really do much for me I feel. I'm just trying anything really to get over this hump and find the path back to feeling like me. So figured maybe this could be therapeutic maybe I'm not really sure. I also dont feel hate or anything like that, like it's just feeling numb at times, and feeling like I'm alone even if my wife is litterly a finger away from me. I guess some of it could be contributed to my first parrot, which was given to my by now wife like 7 years ago at this point. Which unfortunately she died after the move due to stress and complications of it. Then I got another bird after some time of grieving since birds make me happy and what not. She unfortunately died due to stress after our basement flooded. That could be a huge factor to how I feel up here. I'm not sure but thanks for listening and I hope all have a great day.",0

120,"a relapse : I had a major depressive episode that lasted almost a whole fucking year and a few months ago I felt so sure that the nightmare ended and that I could finally start living a normal life.I did feel so much better.I started going to a therapist and working on my issues .I managed to stay focused and do really well at school .I started feeling a lot more confident in myself and  I even felt real happiness . I was in a really good place for about 4 months .I was so sure that I would never feel the way I felt when I had a major depressive episode again ,that I would not fall back into that dark pit .And I was so proud of myself for overcoming depression.     And then ,a month ago,some shitty things happened to me.It made me feel powerless ,helpless .I  couldn't come to terms with the fact that something so completely out of my control happened to me.And even though I promised to myself that I wouldn't let that shit interfere with the progress I was making ,it did interfere.I just couldn't help it .The damage was not done overnight .It was bringing me down slowly ,day by day .   At first, I thought I was doing just fine.But then i caught myself having persistent thoughts that once made me decide to take my own life .Then I found myself having difficulty concentrating on my studies ,even though I absolutely love studying and learning new things .Then I started sleeping too much because the incessant flow of thoughts and overthinking made me feel exhausted  .The headaches started.Getting out of bed was becoming more and more difficult.And at a certain point I was so overwhelmed by my feelings that I just literally turned my emotions off .I didn't feel anything .I felt numb and empty.I guess i kind of felt like I had to resort to turning  the emotions off  because keeping up an act of being ok with all the thoughts eating away at me all the time was difficult as hell.My mom started noticing that I was skipping school and staying in my bed all day instead .I could tell she was afraid that I was in a really dark place again.And I just couldn't put her through that pain again.She suffered enough because of me.So I numbed my feeling and started attending school regularly .The whole numbing my emotions thing was working out just fine for me.I went to school .I didn't think about anything ,I didn't feel anything ,it's like I was there but my mind was somewhere else . I tried to put a smile on whenever my mom was around .    Obviously I couldn't keep escaping from my own thoughts forever .This would have been way too easy to be true . A few day's ago all the thoughts I tried so hard to avoid  just burst out and it feels so fucking overwhelming .   I just can't believe that I am feeling all this shot again .I was so sure that the nightmare had ended .   I doubt someone finished reading this because it came out way too longer than I expected ,but anyways I just wanted to share this with someone because there's literally nobody I can talk to.I just needed to get this out of my system.

121,It's like teachers got worse after being told I have anxiety and depression : ( This is a bit of a post to get rid of my anger )I talked to my school guidanc councilor and she told the principal that I was going to therapy for depression and anxiety. She told teachers to consider that when giving out to me for certain things.

So I was working on my computer turned off. I went to the teacher kinda panicked because I had 3 days to finish ( I'm finished now :D ) and I needed computer to work I told him this and he sat me in a corner of the room and gave me paper and told me to work on I couldn't so just doodled on the paper and got lunch time detention. This was maths.Then in English I was sleeping after finishing my work. This teacher is usually really understanding. He came up to me slapped the table next to me and said if you wanna sleep get out of my God damn class lemme see your work. Showed him the work he told me it was about what he expected from a 3 year old. I re write it he says it's terrible and that I need to do it for homework. Next day I did more than he wanted me to do ( 250  word essay expected and I done 300 - 350 ) he says he couldn't read the writing and that I need to do it AGAIN I refused got kicked out of class had to go to the principal and she said I should work to his standards.

126,"Struggling to keep Breathing. : I'm not sure even where to begin. I'm trying to work through it, through the thoughts, the urges...honestly it doesn't seem worth it anymore to be here. I love when people say ""you have so much to live for!"" As if they know what goes on behind closed doors. They don't. I'm on medication, go to therapy, the whole nine. Nothing seems to really help. Of course I have my highs and lows. But, recently, its been a lot of lows. It's crazy how people tell you they ""care"" or ""will always be there for you"" and then it becomes ""too much"" or ""too often."" Breathing is just becoming a struggle and I'm not sure I can handle all that goes on inside. I feel like I am going to explode. Just don't feel like I deserve to live. I'm sure some would agree.",0
127,"I was, and am, scared of getting better : Before I was out (I'm ftm) I was severely depressed for years, and was even suicidal for a while. I hated it, all I  wanted was to feel okay most days and when I came out, it was like a flip switched in my brain. I wasn't just okay, I was genuinely happy most days. I hadn't felt that good since I was 7 at the absolute oldest. In some ways, I felt like a completely different person; I became more empathetic, my grades went up, I had more motivation then maybe ever before, I completely stopped doing self harm, including pinching, which is something I started doing as a form of self harm when I was around 8, but I was still me in the sense of personality. For once, I truely felt like myself. That said though, the bad days became so much worse; I wasn't used to it, it wasn't my norm anymore. I'm still so grateful to have been able to experience that, to know what it felt like to function normally. When things first started to get better trough, that was exactly what I was afraid of. That it would be worse when things got bad, and if it got really bad again, I wasn't sure if I even would be able to recover. To an extent, I was right. Now, the period of constant okayness is ending. I'm having less and less good days, and it's awful. I'm having more breakdowns than I did when I was suicidal, and when it happens now, I almost always get really close to passing out, and that never happened before. I just want this to be over and I don't care if that happens because I get better again, of if it's because I get used to it again, I just want this to stop.",0

138,"Retro-active suffering? : Over the past three years my emotional and mental health have worsened. I've struggled with self harm, alchohol and a few other destructive habits. Everyone around me was fine blaming this on a the passing of a close loved one, nice and simple cause. But over the past three years I've slowly been suspecting that some of my character flaws and bad habits aren't as simple as what I initially thought they were. So maybe instead of being lazy/stupid (I still believe those are issues that I'm working very hard on.) maybe it has something to do with the intense spiraling fear I have of confrontation, anxiety, poor, very poor self image. Basically it feels like as I've had depression/anxiety/trauma/negative behavior patterns explained to me by friends/media/ and cultural osmosis.... I ended up going âhuh, that clinical description of anxiety sounds a little familiar in a frightening sense.â?I do and feel things that sound insane when I describe them to myself. But at the time I can't help but feel overwhelmed by these things. I'll abuse physically and emotionally myself, feel swallowed by panic, fear and intense doubt just by a minor argument, or trying something new that will be good for me. I've never described myself as someone who struggles with depression as I was growing up. But I realize now that I hurt myself in so many ways not just physically. Is it possible that I've always had these mal-adjusted traits and I'm just now learning to express them properly? Sorry if this is stupid and rambling. I'm not trying to claim any undeserved attention. I know there are people with much more to struggle with. I am doing better the past few months. I've been working hard on my self and where I'm at in life. I just worry sometimes I'll always have these destructive tendencies inside me.",0
139,"Methylphenidate in depression : &amp;#x200B;Hi everyone! I finally decided to join reddit and hope that I chose the correct subreddit.  Maybe some general info: I am a 23-year-old female student. I was diagnosed with depression last year (have had it since I was 15, but I never took it seriously unfortunately, thought I was just lazy etc, last year I finally decided to get some help as I was barely functionalâ? Anyways, I started CBT some months ago and while it is not bad, I wanted to try something medication-wise, but I am very sceptical about SSRIs which are still the first line of treatment. I read about methylphenidate being used off-label sometimes in depression and wanted to try it because of the depression and the concentration troubles I have had for a very long time. I got a small amount of 10 mg pills from someone (no, not a doctor...) and tried one yesterday. I started at 5 mg, after a while I felt my surroundings to be a bit âdimmedâ? but no improve in focus, so I took the other 5 mg. Then I got calm and relaxed, my anxiety (which I had not really noticed before) was gone and after the effects wore off, I felt like I had just done something very relaxing and fell asleep. Nothing productive done during the time it worked, unfortunately.So today I started with the full 10 mg pill. Nothing. Not even side effects (yesterday I had cold hands and some thirst). I took another one an hour after the first.I got a bit calm again, but barely felt the difference, then tried to meditate. I then took another one, again nothing!! Just feeling a bit sleepy now.Could someone maybe comment on why I reacted like this? I know it would be only a theory but I am very curious. I will give back the remaining pills I have and do not intend to try it out more, as I feel at 30 mg I should have noticed something. I know that ritalin only inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, so maybe I was low in them in the beginning? I would be willing to try maybe wellbutrin or a MAO inhibitor, but I doubt I can just get them âon demandâ?(whereas I would easily get an SSRI etc.)I feel like what I experienced yesterday sounds more like what medications that work on GABA do. I know that self-medication isn't the way to go but given the fact that ritalin wears off so quickly I just wanted to give it a shot, mainly because of depression/focus issues and high distractibility. I know that it is âabusedâ?by students for more focus etc. and I would have loved it if it worked like that, but I really can't see how from my experiences :D. Also, I do not react to caffeine anymore, I remember my first cup of coffee as well as my first energy drink, I was so alert and calm/could order my thoughts better. Even after some weeks of caffeine abstinence I do not get these effects anymore.I will probably go to my GP soon and also talk to my psychologist; I am just curious if any of you have had similar effects (without having AD(H)D).Sorry for the long post!",0
140,"I am 350 pounds, clinically depressed and hate my own existence. : I'm 350 pounds, 5 foot 9 and thanks to a 100 pound weight loss 5 years ago now partially balding :( of course gained the weight back. I'm clinically depressed though lately I've gotten some medication that helps somewhat though it still hits hard. I've always been overweight ever since I was little. At 22 I managed to turn things around and go from 310 to 180 pounds in 14 months. I tried to date in college at that point, but after nothing but constant rejection by being flat out ignored what little self esteem I got from losing weight fell apart. Just in my last year or college I tried to lull myself 5 times though chickened out right before success. Then over the next two years I put the weight back on and am now 350. Physical attractiveness has always been something that has been the most important to me because it was the one thing I never had. I've been told in the past I'm handsome, funny, witty, caring, and hard working, but none of that gets a girlfriend. Even if I am handsome my weight makes me a 2/10 at the very best. Nothing that I am matters so long as I am the way that I am. 26 years in and not once have I gotten one phone number let alone a date. At this point all I can see myself as is a blight. I hate my own existence with everything I have because I am everything that I don't want to be. None of the positive traits people have said about me have done anything for me in getting the one thing I want most, a companion. All because the one thing women value most is what I have never had and seem doomed to never have.

150,"FIRST POST! : # So I found this Sub-Reddit a year ago and I had nothing to share about my depression, but now, I really want to share my experience about it and I think I would feel a bit better sharing with you. P.S.- Sorry for my 'not so fluent' English!I am just a regular teenager from Dhaka, Bangladesh and well, I had a really happy and sweet childhood. My life turned upside down when I turned 16 a couple of years ago. Before then, my parents were kind to me and understood what I wanted the most, and I had lots of friends. Therefore, I had enjoyed a really good life.* I was in Grade 8 and I had a crush on my batch mate. Unfortunately, I cannot tell her name due to my insecurities. She was nice, beautiful and always had a 'radiating glow' face. My feelings grew for her and so in early 2017, I have decided to tell her about my feelings. I never knew that it was for my immaturity that it had to cost a lot. Without any consciousness, I went 'too fast', asking her out. The consequence? Well, an usual rejection. I was too dumb to understand the reason why she rejected me, yet, I kept on asking her what was the reason behind. The entire school got to know about this and I have insulted by my friends a lot. They used to tell me that she was way beyond my league or I absolutely don't deserve her, but the most hurtful one was that some of my batch mates used to call me GAY or even worse FAGGOT, since to them, I can never date someone. One day, I was so pissed listening to the same insults that I created a scene inside the class in front of her and her friends. I had to take the fall, and people used to label me as a ""LUNATIC"" and called me GAY more often. I could not tell it to my parents and I kept it shun until 2018. That is the beginning where I started to feel frustrated and depressed.* The days were getting worse when my academic results started to decline in Grade 9 and at that time, I had a year left for my O-Levels examinations. My mother, who used to be my biggest supporter and best friend, started to show cruelty and she used to impose harsh rules and even curfew at home. She even insulted me each and everyday, always compared my abilities to others who are far more successful than me. I always wished to have a good recreational time during the weekends and my mother never let me have one. My father, who admired me the most, started to feel the same like my mother and supported what my mother said directed to me. However, it was my elder sister who has supported me throughout my dark times and I was and still am grateful having her. I felt so diminished and unfortunate seeing my friends having such supporting parents whereas mine never appreciated who I am. I felt so lost having no partners beside whom i can share how much pain I was suffering from.* Fast forward to 2019 and my O-Levels exams had concluded. Unlike, many kids, my summer vacation went bleakly and had no form of fun until our family had spent a little quality holiday trip in India. Unlucky that my O-Levels had to published during that time, my time in India went dull. The good news was that I got 2A\*s and 4As and my parents were ""extremely"" happy till they got to know that there were more people who got way better results than me. After hearing it, they were  a bit sad at first. Three months later, my mother got the very opportunity to insult me with the very result I put too much effort on. I cried for a week without them knowing and since then, the feeling of being A SORE LOSER has started to grow gradually.* My O Levels results has become a turning point in my life. Not only I let my parents down, but I lost my friends. After the results were published, it seemed like all of my friends hate me and I got negligible attention from my friends even more. Two of my best friends now do not talk to me often and they are now of their own business. My other friends formed a group of theirs, leaving me behind. The worst part is that I am now inferior to them. Every day since, I have been a helpless victim of bullying and mental torture. It's sad to know that one of my closest friends have even started to traumatize me with my shameful past incidents in front of people.Now, I have grown more stressed, hopeless and weakened than ever. I have never felt so much isolation and gloom in my entire life. I had continual suicidal thoughts and even attempted once, but I must not make my family sad. Amidst all these, I must show my smiling face to my elders and everyone. Why? In case of our so called ""brown community"", there is no such thing as ""depression"", and funny thing is that all it takes is just a glass of water to just cure your depression. How disgraceful my own society is!I know I made this too long and boring as it is my first time I am sharing with you people but I desperately need some eager audience who could actually understand how depression looks like from a country filled with filth and corruption. This might sound too weird but I believe that sharing my own narrative can somewhat help to grow and rebuild a beautiful life again as I had in my childhood. Thank you.P.S.- I had gone through several therapies but as I said, the psychologists as well are DUMBFUCKS. They told me to drink water and take breathing sessions, which made absolutely no sense at ALL!!!Amidst the dark cloud, however, there is always a silver lining. I would like to thank to my inspiring friends who read my situations and understood what sort of hell I was going through. Without them, my life would have been more miserable and filled with more regrets. They have encouraged me alot and I'll never forget for what they've done for me. I hope you would also understand what I try to interpret through this long, (scrambled) post!",0
151,"My story. : On Feb 1st I decided I was done fighting. I couldn't take anymore. I grabbed as many medications as I could and started swallowing pills. This would be my 5th attempt. The difference this time was that my wife and son were home. My wife knew about my other attempts but had never actually seen or caught me before. This time she caught me. I saw the pain and hurt on her face. The raw emotion. She immediately called 911 and tried to stop me. It had never occurred to me just how much something like this would hurt her. I couldn't take it. I left the house and started walking. Waiting for the medications to take affect. For something to happen. I was met on the street by an officer, followed by a couple more and then an ambulance. I tried to lie to them and tell them I wasn't who they were looking for but they ultimately got me to hand over my license and found out the truth. I was taken to a hospital and forced to drink activated charcoal. I do not recommend this. The taste was horrible. After 3 cups full of the stuff they decided to watch me. I wasn't allowed to be alone. Not even to change clothes into the hospital scrubs. I understand why. And since I'm a diabetic and some of the medications I swallowed were for diabetes they had to check my blood sugar every 15 minutes. That in itself was not a wonderful experience. Left with nothing but my thoughts and the annoyed hospital staff that had to watch me I got to relive the memory of my wife finding me over and over. The hurt I saw will haunt me for years. I was finally moved to the ICU where they could keep a close eye on me and make sure the charcoal was doing it's job. I met with multiple psych doctors over the next 3 days. All asking the same boring questions. Still being poked and checked, but at least it had been changed to every hour. Even throughout the night I was checked. This made it almost impossible to sleep. Finally it was decided that I was a danger to myself for now and I was moved to the psych ward. At least there I had some privacy. Though I was still checked on every 15 minutes to make sure I was safe. I attended groups and the therapy there. They adjusted my anti-depressant medication and my mood stabilizer. After many long talks with my wife and the therapists I was let out. Almost 2 weeks later. The medication helps but is not a cure. I'm working with a therapist in outpatient twice a week and I'm fighting to reclaim my marriage and show my family I'm here for the long run. There are still bad days but I remember the pain I did cause and would have caused on more family and I continue to fight. I'm not sure why I'm writing this but it does help. For anyone out there know you are loved and you will be missed if anything happens to you. You aren't alone. We are all fighters.",0
152,i want to scream : i'm so angry all the time anymore. as long as i've had MDD (more than 8 years now) i've been so tired. that tired that sleep can't fix. my job makes me miserable but it's the only one in my area that pays well enough to give me an opportunity out. my situation makes me miserable. everything makes me tired. everything seems like an effort. i want to scream and break down almost every day and i just don't have the energy or am at work and have to hold it all in for my 14 hour days. i've never been an addict but it's still a struggle not to throw my life away to drugs in order to stop feeling this way. i know all my therapy in theory but nothing seems to work in practice. words can't describe how much i hate this. the worst is mentally begging for help that isn't there because in reality the only one who can fix me is me. i just want to lay down forever in my warm safe bed and fall asleep and never wake up,0

154,"i know my mom loves me but.... shes sometimes just too unbearable... : i recently finally opened up to mom that i am interested in signing up to a rehab. mostly because i wanted proper psych evaluation and felt the need of structured life to deal with depression and alcohol. now, i must say that i dont have severe alcohol dependance. i dont have withdrawal nor crave for it. i just tend to socialize at bars often because there isnt anything to do around where i live. i wanted to talk about rehab without sounding like im mental, mostly because i didnt wanna worry her. she often overreacts and overreach with things. as expected, she asked me if i am gonna be locked up in a psych ward. i explained to her what it was and what i would be doing in there. but since then she just casually says things like âgee, when are you gonna deal with your addiction?â?and it breaks me. she also knows i smoke weed sometimes to sleep. i maybe go through a pinch a week and only to help with sleeping. i never do it in public and i never talk about it. ive told her this every time she brings it up. i never become irresponsible to daily chores/work because of alcohol or weed.today i had an anxiety attack. i had to go out to translate for her doctors visit and it hit me. after the clinic visit, she wanted me to take her to a local car shop to get her a pair of new tires but i told her that i can do it tomorrow. i rushed home and she called to insist to get the tires done right now. i couldnt explain what i was going through because i was scared shes gonna bring it up later like its nothing and that she wouldnt understand. she started to get frustrated, understandably, and started to raise her voice. she asked if i am too high on drugs to help. then i broke down. i told her that i am just not feeling well while crying. she just replied with âsigh, okayâ?then hung up. now i really wanna go to a rehab. just leave and maybe find a job and live alone.",0
155,Selenium and Magnesium can help a lot with depression : I have depression myself it's been very severe for a while but I've done research on what causes the chemical imbalances and how to fix them as well as what else is wrong. Mercury seems to be the main cause of depression and all mental illness but Selenium and Magnesium can get rid of it over the course of months. These two minerals are both antioxidants themselves and also both increase Glutathione which is the most important antioxidant in the body. Antioxidants fight oxidative a which is a major factor in depression. Selenium also increases metallothionein which is crucial for a good blood-brain barrier and protection from heavy metals. I'm taking these right now although only recently started but I just wanted to tell whoever sees this that there are a lot of different supplements that can help immensely with depression because they help the body deal with what's wrong and what's lacking. I highly recommend anybody struggling like me to start taking these two supplements it can't hurt it can help a lot it could even cure your depression if it is from mercury toxicity like it is a lot of the time.,0
156,The weed is not even working anymore and I'm scared : I don't know what to do anymore. I have 0 friends and no family I can talk to.

It usually helps to stabilize me even a few days after I smoke it but yesterday I smoked it and today I just have the worst anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I  haven't had it this bad for a little while now. I'm scared the weed is not working anymore. This is all I had left and if it's not working my suicidal thoughts are coming back stronger than ever and I'm scared. It doesn't help that I take the train everyday when I'm already suicidal.  I keep getting the urge to go jump in front of it. I have self control but these urges are just taking over rn. It's  so bad I don't know what to do.,0

I dont want to make any post where anyone I know will see it becuase I know how people can react and i dont want anyone to freak out... I've been in a weird rollercoaster ride of depression for about 10 years with severity kinda going up and down. The worst points were in 2013 when I broke my knee for the second time in two years and 2017 when my high school sweetheart of 5 years left me. In late 2018 I got into a new relationship and everything was going extremely well and I couldnt have been happier however, a month ago she left me and look I know that things happen and that sometimes people fall out and things dont work, but there were no signs that it was gonna happen... anyway I know I gotta move on, I need no help there but I'll say this hurts alot and my depression and anxiety have started to strangle me again. I wanna admit finally that over the past 10 years, every so often I contemplate suicide. I know I'll never act on it but it's always there. I know that it's just a transfer of pain to the people around me... but honestly, it's always been there... I dont know why either.

161,"Constantly regretting past decisions, can't get over them, what to do?? : Idk if this is the best sub but I kinda need to vent/rant (again) while also sort of seeking advice. I am currently living in a state of constant regret over my decision as to where I went to college, and I cannot get over this regret no matter what. Even when I go through days of not minding it (usually because busy schoolwork and studying has me distracted), the pain of regret always comes back. I try to look for advice, but all I'm ever told is that I âjust have to move on,â?or that I âjust have to get over it.â?But that's where my problem is because I just can't. My question is *how*. How do I?I'm a second semester freshman in undergrad college. When it came down to making a decision, I was left to choose between a large, decent urban commuter university in my city where my best friends were attending and dorming together (there's some on-campus dorms) or a small T50 liberal arts college, and I chose the liberal arts college because of its better rankings, better reputation (I think), and because I thought I would want to attend a liberal arts college. In hindsight, while I do like the smaller classes and personable relationships with professors, who really care that all their students succeed, I'm not so sure if I care so much about the liberal arts education as compared to a larger university. My family heavily pressured me to go to a liberal arts school because they thought it would be the best for me, and because I'm undecided and undeclared, and when it came to decisions, they heavily pushed me towards choosing the liberal arts college, so I did, though I had also done my own research and consideration too to be fair. I forewent living with my best friends at the city university for the completely new liberal arts college, which at least on paper seemed to be good because you always hear that college is supposed to be that time of personal growth and you discover yourself and who you are and what you like.I've struggled with social anxiety pretty much all my life, and while I haven't been medically diagnosed with depression (though I haven't really sought out a diagnosis either), I do have a lot of seemingly depressive episodes, thoughts, and the traits common and seen among depressed people (so I'm really sorry if I come across presumptuous here, I know lots of people actually struggle with depression and have been diagnosed). A lot of people look forward to college but I was the opposite. Completely nervous and anxious. I wanted to go with my best friends because, well, they were my best friends and I thought that could help make the transition for me to college a lot easier. I still want(ed) to personally grow and develop, make new friends, meet new people, discover myself, and all that crap, but I believed as someone with social anxiety that would help make me more confident in my place (though I also feared complacency). Towards the latter half of my high school career, I was blessed to finally find a âfriend group,â?having been pretty much lonely all my life with maybe one or two friends at a time. But even among that friend group, I only really had, like, two really close friends - everyone else is a friend, but more so the kind I just hang out with, you know? It happened that those two close friends of mine (as well as another friend of ours) were going to dorm together at the city university and I was really tempted to do that too, live with them, but my family told me (and I told myself) that would be wrong, I was just being motivated by my short-term desires and would just be following my friends. But on the other hand, I thought it could benefit me in the long-term too because it could make me more socially confident (after finding my friend group in high school I definitely became more confident, not 100%, but comparably more open and comfortable than before, but now I've completely regressed again). Plus I didn't really think I was âfollowing my friendsâ?in the sense you usually hear, like a boyfriend foregoing a really great education for a field he was passionate in just to go to a school with his girlfriend that had his desired program but it wasn't as good apparently, because I honestly had (and still don't) no idea what I want(ed) to major in or do with my life as a career. But I was worried about foregoing the opportunity to attend that better ranked liberal arts college, and ultimately I chose it, not out of happiness or excitement but because I thought maybe it would be best for me, and I feared losing that opportunity to attend.Fast-forward and I am completely depressed here. I have no friends and am completely lonely. I put in effort to make friends at first and I failed, and I have no energy to do so anymore, and I'm even starting to lose the desire and motivation to (although I don't want to be lonely either). Partly due to being burnt out from the extremely rigorous academics at this school (it has a reputation for being so), but also due to what I perceive to be my depressive state. I'm considering transferring back but I don't know if I should really, I'm scared to miss out on potential opportunities for networking or growth that I could have in the future if I stayed here but if I left, and also because I'd be transferring down (lower ranked school, less prestigious, not as strong as a reputation I think). But a little part of me says that I just need to find a way to persevere and push through, and transferring would be weak and be giving up, or otherwise a mistake in some aspect, be it personal growth or future/career aspects. I don't know what to do, but either way if I stay I find myself constantly regretting not going to that city school and dorming with really my only close friends, and while I could if I transferred, I don't know if I should or if that would be wise. And I'm worried if I do transfer I will regret that or it will harm me in the long-run or it'll be some mistake or something. I've thought about therapy but I just can't bring myself to muster up the energy to go see a counselor, and when I do have the energy then I just feel like I'm exaggerating all this or they won't help and it'll just make me more anxious (bc it's a school counselor, so they want me to stay, but also bc therapy hasn't helped me in the past when I've tried it).If you read all this, thanks. I just don't know what to do, and even for the âwhat'sâ?that I do know, I don't know the âhows for meâ?if that makes any sense.",0

170,"Heart won't stop aching : This is the first time I've been truly open about my depression. Usually I'm able to manage it, but I think I've hit a new plateau and now my heart won't stop aching. It's been 3 days and the aching is unbearable. I might actually die from a broken heart, which is something I welcome. I've had a death wish for a long time now. I've had my depression since I was in High School. I grew up in an abusive home (physical and mental) and no matter how times DYFS, now called CPS (Child Protective Services), came for a home visit they never ""saw"" any abuse happening. I now own a copy of every report for when DYFS was called. It's 200 pages thick, not exaggerating. You think if they had printed the entire history they finally see something wasn't right. But, that's just a side rant about a broken system.Since I grew up in a broken home I was a bit weird and didn't understand half the things I said or did were not normal. This led me to be ostracized by my peers and even by my teachers to the point that they would sit by and watch me be bullied because of the reputation of my parents. I once had a student jam a pencil into my head and I was sent home for self-defending myself against him. This caused me to be alone to my thoughts 24/7 because I couldn't express myself at home or outside. I had no friends, no family, and no support. This caused be to become severely depressed by the time I was 14. I didn't even cry anymore because I became accustomed to the pain of being alone and the abuse and thought it was normal. When I turned 18 I ran off with a man I became engaged to after only knowing him for a month. I realize now I was just trying to escape my life. I would end up enduring 6 months of mental torture from this man. He would lock me in the house with no way to contact anyone in the world. Tell me how beautiful I was, but then an hour later berate me for how hideous my body looked. He would secretly tell his friends what a terrible cook I was and how worried he was to leave his dog alone with me for fear I might kill it. Even though he would use a ""baby voice"" to ask me to cook for him or watch his dog. Some nights I had to sleep on the floor because he would be mad at me for something. But, my mental psyche didn't truly break till after he raped me and started withholding things in exchange for sexual favors. I was at a all time low with my depression and anxiety that I took a whole bottle of Tylenol and poured the contents into my hand ready to commit suicide. I stared at all the pills in my hand for what felt like an eternity. I raised the pills to my mouth and looked at myself in the mirror and started to ball my eyes out. I didn't commit suicide, but something did die that day inside of me. Looking at myself in the mirror getting ready to kill myself really put things into perspective to me. After an hour of crying on the bathroom floor I got up and escaped that night from my ex-fiance. It would take years after that for me to get my life on track. But, I managed to get 2 degrees, a decent job, friends, and a dog of my own. I went through a lot of healing from my past and reached a point in my life where I was a bit happier. I mean my anxiety and depression were very easy to trigger, but I was able to recognize my own toxic traits and manage my depression. Despite being the strong independent person, I still couldn't find love. That wholesome, intimate love. I'm now trapped in this generation of ghosting and insincere emotions. I'm trapped in this pattern of feeling like I connected with someone until they ghost me or tell me ""You're a great guy, but I just don't think we're romantically compatible"" or feel like I was used for sex. Then I did meet someone who I connected with very deeply. He was so sweet to me, very kind, compassionate, understanding. It really felt like this was gonna go somewhere meaningful and then out of the blue he tells me he has to end things because he's moving after matching in another state for work/his research. He said it was a difficult decision, but it didn't make sense to have a relationship if he was going to be moving. I would of been willing to move with him and now my heart won't stop hurting. I don't know how to respond to his messages anymore. I can't even cry it hurts too much. I haven't been able to sleep and my heart hasn't stopped aching. I honestly don't think it's going to stop.Life has just been so painful to me, especially with love that I wish I could just die already. I've already become completely numb to ever being open to love or emotions so what's the point anymore? What's the point of healing from your past, if the present doesn't return the favor? I don't know what to do. I just want to stop hurting already. I might not even wake up tomorrow and I'm praying that will become true. I just can't do life anymore, it makes no sense to me. I've tried to be a good person, hoping one day I could reap the rewards and now my life is almost halfway over and still nothing. I don't even know why I'm writing this out, it's not making me feel better.TL;DR: Grew up with depression due to abuse from home and school. Turned my life around after attempted suicide. Met someone who I fell deeply for and suddenly decides to break it off from me. Leaving me in a pit of depression with my life",0
171,"Forgetting past days with past selves when engulfed by depression and dark times.. Realizing this might just help me : Before depression takes full control and has my head filled with only negative and sad thoughts, there  is this stage in which you are free to be edgy, to be the emo and someone who has the energy to even analyze the oncoming depressing thoughts, to compare future and past, to get confused. But when the negative and numb thinking becomes the habit that we almost willingly turn it into, we simply let go of what we were and what made us who we are, before depression transcend in our lives. As if we welcome the new sadly comforting depressed life, and discard the old busy life. As for me, this is one of the most surprising yet chiling realizations  I've had when having the deep talk with the psychologists or friends. I could only react bewildered when people make you remember who you are. ""You got some of them dark jokes"" ""somthing you probably can help me with etc"".   I guess the pros of socializing when depressed, is that it kicks you back into place.  So when I'm depressed i will try to remember who i was, yesterday, a week or a month ago- Despite the self hatred and despair. In that way, it might just help me. I sound like a therapist talking to a depressed 13 yo, i know. But i sorta hope this is uplifting.  But I wanna add the fact that I'm 18, and I've had depression 3 times in my life. And maybe I have yet to discover what real depression is, or haven't lived long enough to actually state this as matter of fact",0

175,"How can I get out of depression, when I don't even know what 'normal' feels like after more than a decade of depression : I'm 20 yrs old and I have been depressed for as long as I can remember.

Most of my family is estranged and I truly just have my dad. I know that if it weren't for him still being alive, I would have done it.I truly don't think I've ever been not depressed. Today, I just had the realization that it's been 10 years of 'official' depression, aka when they diagnosed me. It hasn't been better. It's been worst,  and they pain of knowing it's been so long makes it far far worse.So my question is: how can I get out of depression, when I don't even know what 'normal' feels like?

177,"I need some help and I didn't know where else to ask : Finally, tomorrow.Yesterday was difficult. Almost from the moment I wake up, I had some sort of panic attack. I was having shortness of breath and felt uneasy throughout the day. I've done most of my coping techniques to calm down -- cleaned my room and the kitchen a little bit, went outside for some sun and fresh air, trimmed my beard that I've been thinking about doing for days, and whatnot -- to no avail. I try to counteract it by writing positive things on my journal. It didn't do much. Though, towards bedtime, I felt a little better, relaxed. At that point, I just wished that it'll not continue through the next day.For several days now, and even weeks, I think I've done good. I've been asking myself ""healthy or not healthy?"" so I can calibrate my actions towards healthy throughout the day. It's quite effective, but not wholly. There is a time that I thought it would be healthy to go outside and have some sun. I did, but I also smoked a cigarette, and I might have a walk to the store to get some more later. I know, it's bad, but I'm kind of riding along with it. I feel like it's better to go out and walk to get some cigarettes than to stay indoors for the rest of the day and sulk. At this point, I just try to get out of the house more often, and sometimes I compromise to do just that. I just think that that's healthier.The thing though  I feel that at some point, I wouldn't know if I'm becoming truly healthy or not. Maybe, at one point, my ""healthy"" is actually unhealthy and I wouldn't be able to tell. I think I'm ready to get professional help again. It's been a full year ever since I last spoke to a professional. I suddenly stopped going because I felt that it wasn't going anywhere, and I felt dismissed by my therapist. The latter may be subjective. Maybe I just can't move on from my ex, like she said, and not about coming back to the place where I was once I felt like myself. I asked her once if coming back to my homecountry was a good idea. I thought that was the last time and place that I felt like myself without all the heavy depression(relatively), that may be it'll make sense to go back. Yes my ex was there, but so was my friends, school (at that time), and me. She replied, ""you just miss your ex."" I couldn't said no because yes, I did. Then she continued on with god knows what because at that moment, I remember closing shut. Ever since, I haven't opened up to anyone and have been enduring this shit on my own.And god be damned, my last year was my most difficult. Everyday, when I woke up, I am greeted by a slur of self-depreciation. I don't even get it. How is that my first thought of the day? How did it surpass ""I'm thirsty"" or ""I need to pee."" I have suppressed most of my thoughts of previous happiness, mostly with the aforementioned past life. I thought, ""those are not yours anymore and it's heinous to even think about it."" Consequently, I've lost all my contacts from that time. I'd like to celebrate me after I moved, but I just can't see anything to celebrate. I've kept a journal almost throughout the year. I wish I can say that I've progressed, but no. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I was the same. I stagnated for almost a year (not counting the past years, that I've done so as well). I find little to distract me from my misery. I tried to play games, do some chores, watch movies, etc, but the thought would just catch up. ""Nothing you do matters. All of it is only a farce."" I tried hard not to compare myself to others' progress, but whenever I do with my own, there's nothing. Everyday it's a little better, sometimes worse. I coasted. I convinced myself that that was me. I really do deserve hell for all what I've done, and to justify them, I'll need to kill myself.It was difficult to think otherwise because for the one good thing that I have guilt-riddenly thought that I have or done, I have ten bad things to convince me that I deserve to stay in hell. It's still difficult to this moment. Now, I hope that there's a way for it not to be, or at the very least a little easier to be alive. I'm 28 now, a college dropout, no work experience, no savings, no friends, none anything. It's difficult to imagine that I'll be someone someday from this point of view, but I have hope. Finally, I can see myself past my depression.I wish I could say that this is the end, but it's merely the beginning, and the most difficult. I've been contemplating for days now to ask help from my family, but I'm frightened with what they'll say. The last time I confided with my parents, they make it all about themselves. They told me that I had a difficult time is because I was far away from them. It may have contributed to the problem, but I can definitively say that they are not what makes me. I knew that I was having trouble. I have my internal contradictions, but it wasn't them. They just turned me off, but all I have now is them. I don't have anymore friends to confide with. Their lives are so far away from when we last interacted that I don't think they want to go back to a time when I was in their lives. I don't want to burden them anymore. God knows I have done enough to bring misery to their lives, and I'll hate myself if I added some more.I have no other moves left. I have hope now, but I feel stuck on this part. I need some encouragement and humility to push through this next step, to get help. I thought maybe I can find it here. I didn't know where else to go. Please. I know I can do it, but I feel frightened and feel unable to. I apologize for being selfish and needy.",0

180,"I need to get this story off my chest : So... this is one of the horror stories of my life. A while ago I was very unhappy at my job and being fired from the previous one I didn't want to screw this one up too. I was already on Lexapro for MDD and Lorazepam for GAD. I was feeling so shitty, I just couldn't do my job... and I had a pack of Lorazepam. I took one, it didn't help like usual. Took 2, nothing. Before I knew it, I took much more... to this day I have no idea how many and why. I don't remember. I started to feel sick so I told my manager I need to go home. She said yes. I was working really close to home and back then I still lived with my parents cuz I couldn't afford to move somewhere else. As I was feeling very drowsy, I crossed the main intersection to my house and I collapsed before reaching the pavement. A guy saw me and ran to me. Again, I don't remember much but he told me he was a trained professional. Everything is such a blur. He started to walk me home and I manages to tell him where I live but afterwards I don't remember much. I remember just waking up in my bed surrounded by paramedics. They were injecting something in my arm. Then, I passed out again. I woke up in a blur, my mom told me the guy who brought me home told them that I must have taken something. My mom is a doctor and she called the ambulance. She was crying. I didn't realise what has happened. She also told me that the paramedics asked me how I could have been so irresponsible because I put my life in danger. Apparently I told them I didn't care about my life but I don't remember saying so. My mom asked if I had done it on purpose and to be honest I don't know. I guess initially not but when I was on many pills I really didn't care what would happen to me. And to this day it scares me that I've done this. Did I really value my life so little that I put it in danger for a shitty job which I hated with all my being?I told my parents that it was a mistake but I honestly don't know if it was. However after a few days they forgot the incident or they didn't want to talk about it anymore. And to this day they don't believe that something is wrong with me. It's crazy. The point is when I think of this story I'm scared that I might really hurt myself one day. Especially at work because at work I am more depressed than I have ever been in my life. Anyone else?

191,"What does ""getting better"" feel like? : Hi! I'm a 16 years old girl, so I'm still quite young and at a very confusing stage in my life. Having recently been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety doesn't really make it better I suppose. Now my mental health has been steadily going down since 5th grade/11 years old. I never even though i would turn 16, let alone get rid of my suicidal thoughts. So it did ""get better"", because I grew to no longer wanting to kill myself, becoming clean of self harm and actually becoming a person with a social life that I'm even a bit proud of. Still it's not. Good? My suicidial thoughts are gone but only because of the immense guilt they bring me, most of the time i wish i wouldn't have a family or friends just so that I could end it all. Life is hard. I don't have the motivation to do anything. I literally can't imagine a happy future for me or any future at all to be honest. I also have been getting SO much worse since a few months ago. Anxiety attacks have become way more frequent, my derealization symptoms have been acting up like crazy - going outside is overwhelming and makes me want to cry and hide. It's all just too much, I don't know how to handle it and now even the friendships I worked so hard for begin to crumble bc I can't be a good friend right now, especially to the friends that also suffer from mental illnesses. So, what does it feel like to ""get better""? How do you do it? Therapy hasn't worked so far, it seems to have made it worse even though my therapist is a wonderful and competent woman. How does it feel like when therapy ""works""? We're thinking of getting me on medication, what is that like? Is it scary? I am kind of scared. I tried denying that I'm mentally ill for so long, I guess I'm just hoping to hear of some experiences because I don't understand anything that is going on.

192,"Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you (27 M) : Alright guys kind new here, This might be a lengthy post so please bear with me. I developed depression anxiety at age 17 just one day I felt fatigued and didn't wanna do anything I enjoyed anymore. The feeling never left after that. I was like that for two years without getting any kind of treatment but was still able to have a job and go to school and I was doing quite good. I finally decided to try and anti depressant (Zoloft) and it picked me right up. After some time it quit working and the depression came back not worse just the same. I went through every single anti depressant available after that and I landed on prestiq which also stopped working after some time and cymbalta after which also stopped working after some time. My psychiatrist then recommended abilify. I got on abilify in conjunction with cymbalta. It worked right away or so I thought. Made me feel super energetic and wanted to fit so many activities in one day. Eventually I realized that although I was happy, I was doing things I wouldn't normally do ( spend money, sleep with a ton of women, get tattoos) this lasted 2 years. Then I said the hell with this I rather be depressed than deal with this. Came off the meds cymbalta and abilify and to my surprise the depression was gone after a month of tapering off, my psychiatrist mentioned that she had never seen a recovery like that. I went without meds for about 2 years. During this time everything came back to normal. I graduated from college (mechanical engineering) aced almost all my classes in 4 semesters except for one course (15/16) got a new job and was doing super well. My life got tough I have a 6 year old child and just keeping up with everything was impossible as I have no family. I got severely depressed again. I was really reluctant to go back on meds because I felt that the only thing that helped ( abilify) made me feel strange and made me do things I wouldn't normally do which sounds soo ridiculous. Well I was losing my hair lol and was looking for things to help my situation and came across something called finasteride. Didn't wanna take it but ended up doing it. I was already depressed and this thing amplified it times 100. Started getting strange suicidal imagery, crying spells, super sad all the time, then one time at the store I'm 100% sure I heard a voice in my head make a comment about my surroundings. This freaked me the fuck out because I was fully aware this happened in my mind. I went to the psychiatrist after that cuz I was sure I was losing it. This was the first time this had happened so I was so frightened. When I got to the psychiatrist I told him about everything expect the voice I heard that day. I was ashamed and he had a student with him (she was super hot haha) anyway he prescribed Effexor and abilify (5mg) and shit got better again. But I got the spending urges and wanting to go out and stuff. Brought this to my psychiatrist attention and switched the abilify to lamictal (100mg) and it worked at the start but I feel like it's starting to wear off. My head hurts all the time, feel nausea all the time, depression is about the same not too bad, no suicidal thinking, ring in my ears and they feel clogged (tinnitus I think), after imagery when I close my eyes sometimes, feel like I'm hearing sounds but only when there's people making noice around me and stuff like work or at home no voices or anything like that. I had something weird right now which I can describe as shutter vision where I think I saw a line of my tattoo twitch but I also flexed my arm so it could be that and I'm just freaking out right now. Has anybody here felt that when they started to develop schizophrenia? Please any advice will be super appreciated. I'm a 26 year old male, only been diagnosed with major depression up until now.i suggested to my psychiatrist about possibly being bipolar but didn't think so. Life has been so rough lately as well. Sorry for the rant once again.I posted the above thread about three months ago, since then I got a new job and started grad school. Recently, I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression again I've been working 100 hours every two weeks, two classes in grad school and my son as well. Has anyone here experienced anything similar to the above? My friend has told me that I am going through A LOT and just to relax. I've been thinking I'm bipolar but not sure as I've never gotten a manic episode or hypomanic as all I remember for the past year and a half is a being depressed and anxious. Really thinking of getting back on abilify but that's really last resort as I don't act like myself when I'm on it but it does lift the depression. Any advice from anyone as what I should do next ?",0
193,"Don't know what to do, feel empty at night, just want to sleep : I've been trying my best to fight my depression, but it's getting hard to figure out the causes of it to actually prevent it. I was feeling fine most of the day, although around the afternoon I felt way out of it, like I was going to cry. I realized I hadn't had any kind of caffeine yet like I usually do, so when I got home around 4 I had a cup of coffee, and worked out (which I usually do in the morning). I felt OK for a couple of hours after but slowly started feeling crappy up to now (9 pm) I video chatted my friend and I could feel a sense of hopelessness coming on, to the point where I got off the call after only a few minutes and cried, partly because of how bad I was feeling, but also because I felt like a mess. I usually get sad at night, around 8, to the point where I don't want to do anything and just go to bed early, but this felt different. I'm on 20mgs of Lexapro, and 20mgs of Latuda. I'm also on Adderall Extended Release because I told my psych I felt like stimulants help my depressive symptoms go away, as well as help my concentration, which they seem like they both do.My main problem is that I feel like my depression is getting worse, but also that I get depressed at night and don't want to play video games or anything like I used to, and really just want to sleep. Maybe it's my Adderall wearing off (I take it around 8 or 9 am) Maybe it's my environment (I've tried to switch up the furniture in my room to basically no effect) Maybe I'm just bored and overthinking it?

198,"My story and trying to seek for happyiness : Well, here i am who would have ever thought that i'm going to be depressed and anxious. Never would think i would end up here, i used to be a happy kid, didn't cared much just enjoyed my life.I created a new account, just to be on this subreddit, don't want to that someone of my âfriendsâ?might find out what is wrong with me. I seem like a normal guy to everyone, i'm just trying to be okay, but it's not an easy ask. Everyone thinks it's just something simple, why would be something yet so simple, so dangerously?I was always kinda the weird guy, i never had much friends i rather enjoyed being alone. When i still was younger maybe 10years old, i always came home happily, turning on my console and just forget everything and enjoy life. I never concentrated on my real life, everything was stressy, i never made my homework, my parents screamed at me for not doing shit, just playing on my console. Whenever i had school, i didn't even cared at all, i just tought about my console what i'm going to do next, because i never had much interest in life. I only had like two friends?I actually went out everyday at some point, it was fun.There was a game, that i really enjoyed playing. I met a lot of internet friends there, i always concentrated on the a internet because it was much easier to get friends.When i was like 12yr old i searched for friends, because it was trendy to have much friends. So i still was a kid and wanted to get a girlfriend, so i've found an girlfriend through the internet, it never was serious but it still kinda affected me in a way. I always wanted to have a girlfriend. Everyone had a girlfriend except me. It wasn't like that, my parents loved me. They gave me much love, i didn't felt unloved something was just missing.When i turned 13, i started âgrowing upâ? I continued to play, but something felt different, my feelings changed. I started feeling kind of depressed, because i didn't had a childhood like everyone else, i mostly was alone playing on my console and writing with my internet friends.I was seeking for happyiness, so i tought i should get a girlfriend. I started randomly adding people, and there was one girl. Let's call her Sun. This girl changed my whole life.We started to write more and more, i felt happy for having her, it wasn't real love at the beginning but i still felt happy. So, we were together for like a few months, until she broke up with me. I didn't cared, because it wasn't serious. Months later i wrote her, that i'm depressed and somehow we came together again.This time things got more serious.She lived like 800km away from me, but we still wanted to meet. ( I was 15 there) I kinda felt depressed, i don't know why. I just had no feelings and i didn't had much friends neither. I had some friends but they were toxic against me. I started cutting myself, it started to be some small cuts, until i began to cut more and deeply. Weeks later i started to cut my face, i still don't know why i cut my face, maybe i wanted attention so someone might help me?The school saw me. They spoke with me, why do i cut myself? i told them i had no sense in life, i'm lonely no one wants me. The whole school is just against me. So i started to get some help from the school, i didn't helped much. But i stopped cutting myself so i don't need to talk with them ever again.It was rather an easy task to stop cutting. Months later, i continued writing with my girlfriend i kinda stopped loving her, but we arranged a meeting at my home. I kind of didn't cared.Two days before we would meet i felt extremely happy. When she was there, i smiled the whole time and felt happy, i never smiled in my life before, i rarely smile. I just don't like it.We were both happy, i never was so happy before like i was with her. We met every vacation  and i was super happy with her.But there was one problem that always followed me. I had extreme trust issues i always tought she didn't love me enough, i'm not good enough i tought she is just going to fall in love with another one.Months later, we met again this time, everything felt good just positive feelings. I was happy with her. Things continued to be good with her for like 2 weeks. But when she came back home, everything was weird, she stopped loving me and.. She just broke up with me, i never felt so much pain before.I stayed the whole night awake, afraid of myself that i might end up my life.Things continued like that for 1year. I slept the whole day, because i didn't want to feel being alive.This is where the true story starts.After some time, i kind of recovered, i turned 16 but i was seeking again for happyiness, i tought of getting a girlfriend, but i said myself i don't want anyone except my ex, i also felt unloved. No one liked me.So i found a drug, called MDMA. I was happy to try it out, giving me the positive feelings i've had with my ex.I contacted a friend of me, we used to be good friends, we kinda had the same interests, so we met, i told her i want to take mdma with her. She told me she wants to try it out too.I didn't informed me much about the drug, so i just took one pill. Didn't feel anything after 2 hours i dropped 2. I had over 600+ mg mdma inside my bloodstream now.Suddenly i started feeling something, i was so happy but minutes later, i felt apart. Because i took to much, i panicked and fell on the floor, it was winter and i was laying outdoor in the freezing cold temperatures. Someone called the ambulance, they picked me up. I tried to talk with them if iam okay they told me, im pretty lucky that i survived.I don't know why, but i gave them the number of my parents, so they called them and they visited me. It's still hard to talk about this, because it left a deep scar in me.They saw me, on drugs and i never felt so bad before.They got me home and talked with me, i told them these things that i feel unhappy and i just needed something.Weeks later, i felt good? Because i was glad i survived and i was happy. Months later the same shit happend, i felt unhappy and cold. I had some friends that used to get high a lot, so i asked them if i could join them.I really liked the feeling, of being high, it kinda made me happy. So i continued doing it for months and months, I was high everyday, after school i came back instantly to my friends just to get high, i wasted all my money on this. (I was 17.) There was one day, i was so high that i had a tought loop and, it just didn't stop. Few minutes later, it ended and i felt better. But when i got home i felt extremely anxious. I had severe anxiety for months, i still have it. I couldn't go to school, the only thing i could do is sitting at home and doing nothing.It got better, but i really started to feel depressed. The feelings i've had when i was younger, it just was some sadness. But now something definetly was wrong with me.Because i still didn't recovered and i used drugs to hide the scars, it only made it worse.I started a therapy, it lasted like a few months. I got kicked out because i barely walker and she tought i was okay, i'm just sad because of my ex.Now i'm here, i'm anxious depressed and i'm afraid of the future. I don't know what else i have left to say, my mind is completely broken. I just felt like writing a short story of my life.Thanks.",0
199,"I'm a Soft Machine; a Vent and a Wish. : I want to get everything off my chest, I'm not concerned with the length of this as much as I want to just spill it all like a God fearing man in a confessional. The years of depression and anxiety has made me fickle. I'm really not a mean person; just emotionally inept as of late. When the passion you had gets drained, it's hard to find a reason to care about what you say or even continue. So if I say something that seems rude or extreme, I'm sorry. Although I'm sure most of you can relate to me on this one. To start, I'm 18 I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and Panic Disorder. They are mostly related to one another and just perpetuate when one flares up. I'm so tired, I'm so unhappy, and the moments where I feel happy are fleeting and don't remain long. I'm struggling more and more to pick myself back up and reclaim my former self. It doesn't much help that when you get prescribed the Pandora's box that is SSRI's, people see you different. Not negatively, just different; a house made of egg shells. Something that could crumble with a glance, and it's not entirely incorrect. So you hide it, because you don't want people to care. You hate to be responsible, hate that they're watching with pressure, hate to be called by your parents because it reminds you of when you were young. Reminds you of what it's like to be you again; seems so long ago. SSRIs remove the flavor of life, emotions. And no matter how much spice you give, you still can't taste it. It's a float, it's a delay. It's a way to postpone your flavor until your brain decides to let you have them back. But even prescriptions upon closer inspection reveal a unbecoming truth. The truth that we aren't as in control as we wish we could be. Our thoughts are a hop, skip and a small oval green pill from being nothing more then a scribble in the sand. But despite the odds, I'm still moving. I'm still here. I won't let my existentialism bring me down more then it has. I wish for one day where I'm happy again, and I wish the best for all of you! Thank you for reading my twice told tale of teenage woe lol.",0
200,Dropped out today : I dropped out of nursing school today. Worked harder than I ever have for years and then realized in the final stretch I couldn't do it anymore. Feeling pretty shit about it. Decided to post in a nursing sub for possible support. Quickly became aware I wasn't welcome there. So now I'm here. I've struggled with chronic PTSD and depression since I was 14 years old. I don't have a family to reassure me everything's going to be okay so I'm just feeling kind of lost. I thought I had it figured out. Now I don't know where to go from here. Feeling pretty hopeless. Sorry if this post doesn't make any sense.,0

202,"My little brother may have cancer and I think meds are causing me to feel strongly about suicide : Hi all, I found out today that my little brother may have lymphoma and he is being tested for it. I'm an absolute mess right now. I just started Valdoxan last night and have not wanted to die more than now. Not sure if it's a meds thing but holy shit. The world is absolutely fucking bleak. I would give my life and more just so my brother could live. He doesn't deserve this and I can't fucking handle it. I don't want to see him in pain or hurt. He has so much potential and he's so kind and just such a gentle presence in the world. I just can't handle this but I would so gladly give him my place in life. I'm also sick with the flu and missing work and feeling like I'm out of my body all together and I started Valdoxan last night. My mind is just somewhere else all together but I've never felt shittier. I've always thought about suicide but now the world just feels colourless and like I'm the outlier. I don't even think I'm living. Is this normal? Do you think it could be because of the meds? Can they kick in this quick? I want to see my GP but he's booked for 3 weeks. I'm sorry I just needed to let this out. Thank you for reading.",0
203,"I cut myself today. : I cut myself while in the shower today. I did maybe 7 long cuts on my wrist. I get that that may seem like a low number but I'm really sensitive to pain so I was actually on the verge of passing out on the last cut. Everyone I've told is absolutely pissed. My girlfriend and I had a rule where if one person cuts, the other is allowed to. Normally it keeps us both from cutting but recently she's been in a hellhole and she needed relief. I tried to stop her, I really did, but she insisted that she would do it even if it ruined the promise. My girlfriend also wanted some space recently, so she hasn't been available to help. I also recently just left the group of friends I had been in due to toxicity and mistreatment of mental health issues. I only have one person so far who has provided genuine support.",0

205,"30 days to decide- Days 1-5 : I preface this by I am suicidal I decided to channel this constant feeling into words everyday and better understand what's pushing me into my constant spiral. For the last five days, I would write for an hour or so, including things I read or old poems that I revised and random ideas that popped into my head. I'm going to do this for 25 more days and decide on my course of action.Day 1:Lately there is this 10-15 second window between the vividness of a random dream and the emergence of my memories and ego. In that window of time, I feel a light sense of ease then I once again remember this is me and I'm still alive and then I begin my day.I sit still in bed for an hour or after a bundle of random thoughts I eventually muster the courage to leave my room, I scan the hall in the hopes that my roommates are gone, I absolutely despise small talk and I sneak into the bathroom to freshen up.If I don't feel too depressed I will get ready to go to class and while it is sometimes engaging I make the mistake of going too late and I have to sit next to someone. Today was such a day, I was 2 minutes late and I had to sit next to some blonde girl and it was at the center of the class room where I was surrounded entirely by conversation.I try not to listen in but ADHD makes it impossible to not hear people when they speak. Some girls were talking about their shitty roommates, some guys were talking about getting laid, and another group was talking about tests and stuff. At one point in class we were talking about the first wave of migration in 500 AD in europe.Some kid raises his hand and asks what they called the USA during this time period. Last semester, I was in a writing class where everyone hated on a style of writing because it was on instagram.I see a common theme in life of blatant stupidity, rampant egotism, hypocrisy on every level, social hierarchy, and the thought of living like this perpetually into my fifties or sixties makes me want to drop out of society.Yet that in itself is just another game of society, so I consider suicide the only rational option. I can't imagine anything making me happy when I am so bored I can barely handle it day by day.I just remembered this funny little moment today, I was walking with my headphones in and I started daydreaming. I was at the top of a bridge, a bunch of cars are zooming past me and a cool breeze passes through my hair. I raise my arms to the side and dive off the bridge.The summer sun gleans in the sky and reflects over the river and my body drops faster and faster as my ears pop. All I can hear is the sound of my body crashing and fading to dark.Somehow that little dream had me smiling like an idiot and as I was opening this door I locked eyes with a girl and she smiled back. I always wondered why people walk around with smiles plastered on their faces. Do people smile because they are imagining their deaths? That thought makes me laughâ?Day 2:I've been thinking maybe I should focus less on my struggles and more on anecdotes, poetry, and funny moments to form this memoir.To commemorate all the lives that have wasted away in their thoughts. I was really curious as to what other people thought of death yesterday and I found a really interesting answer on reddit.""All sensation stops. But all those memories and cognitions still exist. Without sensory input, the mind grasps at the only things it has: memory and logic. Where was I? Oh right, I was dying.Again, no sensory input.So it keeps grasping at that one straw. It keeps remembering. As far back as it can. It fills in the gaps with logic. You don't remember your birth, but you know you were born. So it fills it in.And then there's nothing left. The VCR tape has been rewound... so it goes back again. You live your life. Again. Exactly as it happened. And then you die. Again. And you go backwards. Again.The mind keeps going over this single timeline, this single experience, wearing a groove over and over again until things start to feel... familiar. Overly familiar.It feels like you've been there before. Like you've had that conversation before. Like you've seen that person before. But... no, that's not possible.But eventually, it's obviously possible. Eventually, you can hear that voice in your head that's a passive observer to your own personal hell. It's questioning your decisions. It's wondering why you're choosing to not better yourself.It's warning you against bad decisions. How long will it take to start to listen to that voice? Who knows.At some point, you forget that this was all by design. This is just how the world is. Those other creatures and people aren't me, they're just logical inserts, extensions of the subtle passing faces from that original reality. But what was that original reality? Who was he or she?The separation from the original source makes you feel depressed. You figure there's no sense in trying to live up to your potential. This is all there is. Nothing happens afterwards. And then you die. All sensation stops. But all those memories and cognitions still exist..."" -JimeDorjeI experienced this feeling my entire life and I lived a life in my thoughts. Thinking and rethinking every moment and now I wonder why I persist. That will be all for today.Day 3:I tried to read an old book I used to work on and I couldn't recognize the person who wrote that book, the writing style, the content, the thoughts, nothing felt familiar.It was like I was reading someone else's thoughts, yet I know I wrote it. I started to wonder who am I for everything to change and nothing about me to remain the same.I realize this over and over again that the only thing that has ever stayed the same in my life is that I am deeply unhappy. It's not because of my life or trauma or anything, it's literally because my brain is broken.Antidepressants don't work on me and I use ketamine recreationally to cope temporarily. The effects are so minimal that I have to admit it, my depression is my personality.My shallow well of despair controls my entire life and leads me along. Now that my depression has returned all those old thoughts look awfully familiar here's an old passage I wrote.All people are fundamentally the same:I've found it increasingly that the things I thought I was missing out on are nothing special.The people, their lived experiences, their actions, thoughts, and feelings are all the same.There is no new dimension or added experience to care about. People are so breathtakingly simple, their flaws, their quirks, their obsessions are so easily displayed.I struggle to not show my contempt at their nature yet what else could I say?Idealizing Self Isolation:I idealize my social isolation, I'm so used to being alone that whenever the opportunity comes up to not be alone I decide against it because I am better off alone.I've been alone for the brunt of my life and I expect to be alone for the rest of it. I feel strength in that because I always have myself and I am never uncertain about that but around people that changes.There's talking behind your back, snide comments, bullying, aggression, and overall selfishness. Being around people is and has never been rewarding to me, it's always fraught with insecurity and unhappiness.My loneliness is a strength I use to define myself from other people, everyone else needs love, companionship, and friendship and all I ever needed was myself.This is a part of me to the point where if I do start dating like I am right now or make friends I have distinct understanding that they are transient and when I feel like I need to get away I will disappear.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_These were thoughts I had while I had a partner and got more and more friends. Now I have none and no friends, by design and motivated by a very bad set of experiences that are irrelevant.I am even more isolated and strangely more secure about my disinterest in other people. I have even stronger disinterest in life day by day things pass and the end grows ever so near.Day 4:I've been thinking about my legacy and not as if I would have impact, more as in what lack of impact would I have. As a highly isolated person I don't expect anyone to mourn me, I'm not even expecting a facebook post. Although there is an off chance there would be some faux authentic posts and maybe a few people that knew me would be a little surprised. My only issue is what would happen to my car, cash, and possibly my hidden drug stash. I should probably come up with a plan for my possessions, but at the same time why would I care about that from the other shore? Death is a really handy solution to all your life's problems because without life there are no problems. Ever heard the quote, the opposite of love isn't hate it's indifference? Love and hate are two sides of the same coin, and there's the love of life and the hatred of life. I am on the second camp, I hate life and I want to transition to indifference to life but as long as I am alive I cannot be indifferent to being alive.Believe me I have tried my hardest to not care but it's kinda hard to persist on a tightrope of giving and not giving a shit simultaneously. No matter how deep you hide your desires, no matter how much you reject the notion of happiness, no matter how much you close your eyes to all the happy people around you. You will forever hold the notion that, that could be possible for you. That one day it will all be okay even though it has never been okay and the only constant in your pathetic existence has been crippling anxiety and depression. Hope is my enemy as hopeless as I am I remain hopeful, hopeful about death and even hopeful about life. I am hopeful about everything and hopeless about existing. This is so turbulent and annoying that I can't stand it and even the thought of sharing this makes me more confused about what in the hell I want.I hate feeling like I was born with a prison sentence, I persist out of obligation and I desperately want to desist in existing in such a pointless discriminatory and hopeless world filled with an endless stream of insults and assholes that want nothing but the worst for me. I am so tired of fighting for no reason. Is what I would say if I really felt like that, my real legacy is nothing because death eliminates all your grudges and warmth. That's it for today.  Day 5:My mom calls me everyday, she's in another country and she checks in with me. My sisters talk to me and say hi, and I'll admit the guilt gets to me a little. Then I remember if I am ever honest to my mother about my identity that she will disown and probably wish death upon me. I am contemplating whether or not I should tell her now so I could get that extra kick to push me over the edge. I remember last time I got a kick like that, my partner at the time acted like such a complete asshole and then acted like he had some moral high ground. I hated it so much I couldn't stand his hypocritical behavior so I broke up with him and stopped interacting with other people. Especially people who were a part of his friend group, but enough of that I wanted to present the other side of my kill myself argument. I have a really nice therapist, they helped me a little and made me laugh in therapy. I am awkward like always so I fail to be friendly back but I tend to feel okayish at therapy. I have some friends who reach out occasionally. I have an old roommate who still talks to me. I have an old friend who checks in with me sometimes, a few people say hi to me. I don't know all that absolutely fills my life with joy. I'm going to a group meeting tomorrow, I'm not sure how I'll do. Admittedly I know I'll do terribly and be an awkward silent mess until I slowly escape from the group like usual.   That's the weirdo that I am, I think I'd make a good case study for overly neurotic anxious and depressed piece of shit who has no real insight but is able to confidently state through ego that she knows everything.I've had warm moments in life I just can't remember them right now, is that because of my mental illness? That is so interesting, sometimes I can feel warm emotions and I can remember good moments but right now those don't seem to exist. This has been a chronic problem or maybe its a personality trait.All I know is any narrative of self improvement or feeling better, or feeling happy never lasts eventually I see right through my own facade and remember that I fucking suck. Here's an old poem I wrote when the ketamine was working.[Living as a choice](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/3711178/living-as-a-choice/)I am shocked by the serenity surrounding meFinding closure was no longer a fantasyThe calm that stills the sentient ripples of consciousnessThe departure of lonesome thoughts and inebriationA hole in my chest that could not be put to restYet it all faded away in a moment, a calming respiteWhen the knot in my chest was at its leastThe fence finally undoneTears I've wanted to shed finally runWith the noose on my neckLoose around my chestI can finally lay to rest This morbid festival of painI want to live but not for another's design But for my own will and worth\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Shocking that someone so sad could write something not depressing and yet none of those words look familiar to me, as if written by a stranger. This seems more my tune:What's there to say?The further I go the less I believeWhat's with the need, for me to deceiveNo one even cares about all my screamsI don't even care enough to believeNOW!I could sing a songAnd you should sing a longCome on let it out, don't try to be strongAfter all they're just going to hear it wrongWhat did they tell you?That home is where the heart is?Life gets better if you give it a chance?But what if misery has made its placeLaying its laurels to rest in our spaceEverywhere you go IT followsBeating that drumFlowing in your bloodThat's the siren's song   Of misery's embraceSo sing along you dumb assholeIt's okay I'm fucking disgrace tooSo fuck this shit I'm out",0

207,"In need of help for the future. : Hello everyone, I am fairly new to Reddit and I have never done anything like this before, so it's kinda scary, but I just need a boost. I am currently in my final semester of high school which means my life as an adult is about to begin. For most people this would be an exciting time and would be a cause to celebrate and get motivated, but I have absolutely no motivation left in me. I've been stuck in a bit of a hole for a very long time now. Getting on my feet seems impossible from where I currently stand. I have no vehicle, money, or job which makes college seem so distant and impossible; I want to teach English one day. In my current situation I'm unable to get help with my depression from a doctor and I don't want to burden down the only person in my family who knows about my depression diagnosis I received last year. These four years of high school have been a roller coaster ride and have drained me completely. I started high school with more motivation than ever, but after a while I became scared to even go to school and was frustrated at the thought of it. The friend group I've been a part of since my second year of high school has been torn apart and I continue to feel like I have no one around me to help. It's so scary having negative thoughts and feelings that you know are wrong but not being able to shake them. Finding the motivation to get out if bed in the morning is like looking for a needle in a hay stack.",0

I've been depressed for 6 years now and social anxiety followed, and I haven't told anyone about it. I feel lonely all the time and sad because of it, spending a lot of time sleeping. Trying to find a job is hard, and getting denied nearly every time is crushing as well. Never had a lot of friends growing up, still the case now. I just felt like getting a little something of my chest even if it was just something small. At least I made it this far along, never thought I would a couple years ago.",0

Every conversation is about me and my mental health and my future. I know their intentions are good and that they want the best for me but some reason I just ca't stand it. It makes me feel even worse. The fact that my mental health and my future is even a subject just annoys me. Its like they study me like im an animal at the zoo or something. Ive tried to make new friends but im so fucking awkward that I cant even hold a conversation with people for more than a minute. Ive also never had a girlfriend or just somebody to hug and feel happy with. Ive never felt so alone in my life.",0
211,"Anyone feel their reason/rationality slipping? : This is hard to describe, but I feel like the depression is overall getting worse because I'm less able to distinguish between ""my voice"" and ""the depression voice."" It wasn't long ago that I would get negative thoughts (my friends tolerate me, I'll never reach this goal, etc) and be able to take a second and go ok, this isn't me talking, it's the depression. Like I could point out an irrational belief to myself. Now I'm not sure if my thoughts are rational or not, like the ""depressed me"" and ""me"" have merged. I genuinely don't know if it's irrational to think that I'll never be in a relationship, thinking that some suicides can be considered rational vs the result of a sick brain, or thinking that my depression will only get worse. I thought I would always have reason (barring something like dementia), but even that is questionable at this point and it's scary as hell.",0

219,"Nothing feels like it will ever get better, it only seems to get worse. : Just posting here because I really don't know where else to post. I feel like there's no one else to talk to or the  people I do talk to haven't been making me feel any better. Not a fault with them I guess an issue with me at this point.I feel like my depression is getting worse and I don't know what to do about it. I don't get any sleep lately, I barely sleep 4 hours a day at that and I'm up all night. I have been avoiding sleeping because every time I go to sleep I have constant nightmares. There are no good dreams or normal dreams just constant nightmares of me killing myself, my dad being killed or injured, my mother and sister trying to kill me or some other harm and no one coming to help me. I wake up with anxiety and go to sleep with anxiety. I have nothing that distracts me or makes me feel less stressed anymore. I feel alone and angry and upset. I've been fighting with my abusive mother lately which is making me feel worse than I already feel. I think she's a major contributing factor to my mental health decline but I guess there are other issues not limited to it running in her side of her family unfortunately for me I seem to have inherited mental issues my grandfather started having in his youth and so did my mother. My entire family is prone to mental health problems except my father who's family has none.  I have dreams that bother me lately and I don't really tell anyone about them because I'm worried what they'll think of me. In some of my dreams where my sister or mother is trying to harm or kill me I sometimes harm or kill them while telling them what I feel about them and how they hurt me. I don't like having these dreams because I feel glee and relief when I'm telling them how I feel or harming them in these dreams. Granted they all seem 'self defense' in these dreams but I don't like the feeling of happiness I get in these dreams. The feeling doesn't last when I wake up but I don't like having these dreams. I know I'm not a violent person and despite them abusing me I'd never hurt them IRL but I don't like being left alone with my thoughts and no distractions. It makes me feel like a monster. My friends I have told said these are normal kind of dreams for abused people but it doesn't make me feel any less disgusted when I wake up.  For the last few days my depression has gotten worse. I don't feel anything anymore. Nothing makes me happy and nothing makes me have any feeling. I think I am completely desensitized to violent movies or similar stuff. Nothing makes me feel anything anymore. Crying, which I alternate between doing too much and not being able too makes me feel no relief.  I've been an artistic since I was 9 and art ties into my mental health and if I can't or aren't drawing then I'm not happy. I haven't been drawing. This is both because I haven't because of depression and because I can't because my old pc cannot run a version of Photoshop I have I used for years. I want to use this old version of Photoshop because its sort of my depression comfort zone, so assholes telling me to just 'man up and change programs' aren't going to understand. My issue? I need a new computer. Issue there? no money. I don't have 300$ for the PC I need right now and I''m unemployed and my only source of income is drawing disgusting furry porn on furaffinity I fucking hate and barely get paid anything when I do. I haven't got paid in months and I don't know how long I can 'keep hoping' I'll get money to get my computer so that I can draw again like I used too. I feel like there is no hope that anything with change. The computer and the art are only part of my problems but I think I'd have less issues if I had some kind of outlet for my depression. Honestly the only reason I haven't killed myself at this point is because I am far too unmotivated to actually do it. Weather this is a good thing or not I don't know, who would even miss me? I'm a useless meat sack with no value to anything.  I have crippling medical anxiety as well and literally anything that even remotely cause me harm or pain makes me have a uncontrollable anxiety attack. Have a chest ache probably caused from stress or too much caffeine? probably having a heart attack and dying, time to panic and no one will make me feel otherwise. Been to the hospital over 10 times for shit like this.  Worst of all lartely when I have these panic attacks I hope they are actually what I think they are so they'd kill me. They have not yet.:/ Being terrified of dying and wanting to die at the same time is such a strange feeling.  I have no outlets for my depression and feel nothing anymore. I feel like I'll never draw again and I'll never feel happiness. I'm tired of nightmares. I don't sleep anymore. I prefer the nightmares where Ted Bundy is strangling me while violating me, they're somehow less terrifying and make me feel less anxiety than the ones where my mother is killing me. I am jumpy and paranoid because of my lack of sleep and nnightmares. I cannot seem to relax. To make things worse my 12yr old dog is getting older. We all know what happens when animals get old. We lost two old pets I had since I was 10 last year  a few months apart, who my mom claimed was my fault because I wasn't there for one of them because we didn't know she was going to hae a seizure and die and the other I ""didn't love"" because I had a asthma attack from pet hair in the vets office and almost fainted and broke out in red lumps.  But my fault and I don't love them I guess.  Thanks for reading if you did, I just wanted to get thoughts out of my head for a while.",0
220,help : my brain has convinced me that nobody cares. I'm so close to ending it all I'm so scared. I think about dying so much. I isolated myself from all my friends and family and every time I try to speak to them I get paranoid and I have a panic attack and I can't do this anymore. Im so lonely and I don't know what to do. I'm at my limit. I want to be happy and I want to accept that they don't hate me and they're not using me for their own gain.,0
221,"The happiness mask : howdy everyone!I wanted to touch on an interesting subject for me.First of all I am an 11th grader and I have been suffering from severe depression and ocd/anxiety since the 8th grade...and yes I go to a psychiatrist I haven't diagnosed myself on my own.I take 3 kinds of meds with relatively high doses, but I don't want to discuss that I want to talk about something else!My life isn't the brightest in the first place, but it got worse a month ago. My father passed away at the age of 63...and he was a cancer patient.From all the horrible experiences in my life so far I still believe I haven't seen anything yet. Let alone the dark and suicidal thoughts that I have from my depression. So my question is...I Am turning into such a happy and optimistic person and all this suffering has turned me into a much more mature person. I like to think I am more mature than most teens at my age.Someone told me that people like to give what they don't have. Like if I don't have a happy life, it would make me much happier if I made someone Happy.And it wasn't till recently that I found out that it's true!So it's not like I am pretending to be happy in front of people. It's not a happiness mask it's just that I love being positive to people because that makes ME positive as well!So don't think of your depression as a handicap think of it as a way to get more mature and experience life.Plus a successful person with depression is way stronger than a successful one without something dragging them down!So stay strong and keep fighting guys I know how it is to feel lost, lonely, not knowing who you are, not knowing if you're worth it, not knowing if anyone loves you. But in the end you should matter to yourself. I know you might hate yourself but you have to love yourself and care for yourself. Your mental health is important and don't feel hesitant to ask for help, especially professional help!These are just some thoughts that have been roaming my mind lately!Please tell me your opinion on this subject and I hope I brightened up your day and you're definitely not alone in this world. Take it from a depression patient.Anyways I hope you have a wonderful day!PS I forgot to mention that you're never gonna be always happy but you should keep fighting for happiness",0

But with all this stimulants I notice the same thing, yeah my focus goes up but it's a constant anxious feeling within me. With non-stimulants I find myself to be really tired or burnt out and just more emotionally sad and I feel it makes my mild depression a little worse. I have to constantly be alone or leave groups of people just so I can have the time to bring me self back down again. My hands have been sweaty for as long as I can remember due to this nervousness. And i'm just looking for someone with advice, little tricks and tips to calm down. Just ways to cope with this nervousness and help me with my ADHD. (rp)Any help really is appreciated ð¤",0

There's some days that i wake up feeling like I can do whatever I want to do, and thinking I can overcome my depression, y'know?

225,"We are adults. : My forearm stings. My arm with the scars from the times I was too drunk to behave like a normal person, when I acted out at my friends graduation party night and her sister had to drive around looking for me. The same night we celebrated our graduation, except, I wasnt graduating. Suffice to say, I was upset. I punched a kid. I've been upset my entire life. Though, my less self indulgent years have been spent trying to figure out which mental handicap Ive been lucky enough to experience, I dont think I have anything other than a lull in selflessness. Asked my therapist if she thinks I'm bipolar, I dont remember us getting into it much, asked if she thinks I have borderline personality, she told me, ""when a borderline person walks in a room, you know. You're not borderline.""Every fight I had with my ex I shouted at him for being a narcissist but honestly, I think this is it. If I do have the luxury to blame my poor social skills on a misfire in my brain, then narcissism would be it. Back to my arm, it stings. Randomly it'll do that, years at a time. It reminds me of the amount of contempt I've held toward myself. The utter disdain, embarrassment, hate, for myself. Sometimes my arm hurts, where my scars are which were put there 9 and 14 years ago.I hated myself when I was 12, when I was 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26 years old. Today I'm 27, have been for about two weeks or so. Twenty-seven, alive, alone, in my own apartment, in a state miles away from my past lives, in a place where only one person knows anything at all about me... well that's a lie. I can't seem to get away from my past no matter how far I think I could disappear. A previous co-worker, who should have remained in the past, ironically moved to the same state as me during the same month. Now here we are, discussing when we will meet up again and rekindle whatever relationship we had before. I cannot run away. My life won't let me. It has been too fulfilled with bodies of humans whom I've formed some sort of impression on. My life won't let me leave. I've tried since I was 12. I thought I could die, i thought i could do these silly, childish things.I thought i could drink myself to death but instead, for over a decade, all I did was waste time.So here I am, buying one bottle of wine several months apart at any give time. I have one sitting in my kitchen now, unopened. Here I am.Choosing life. Because the saying goes; if you can't get anything right, join them. ð¥",0

In class today all i could think about was how id do it, what song id play, who to write a note to. All of that i figured out in a span of an hour.Everything else that came to mind made me feel down, but for some reason thinking of my death actually calmed me.

I am constantly tired and think the meds may be attributing to this. I'll sleep a full 8 hours and  have a cup of coffee or two in the morning and still feel exhausted. It's gotten worse ever since my dosage of rexulti was upped so thats why I think it may be connected. I really want to wean off my meds because of the tiredness and they generally make me feel really flat   but I'm afraid my depression will come back if I stop.Has anyone been in a similar position of feeling exhaseted on their meds?

231,"What does Moderately Severe depression mean? : I know I am depressed and I have taken a couple of questionnaire at the Doctors office and it comes out to be moderately severe. I feel incredibly anxious sometimes where I just feel like I am against a wall and I usually end up crying. I feel so powerless when I am like that and in the middle of my anxiety and crying, I hate myself for crying, for feeling so powerless. I seriously have no idea how other people do it. Do they all feel sad and just cheer up after a while ? I am not sure. I have friends who care about me. But to open up to anyone the level of depression I am in, I think I would just scare them off. I dont want anyone to know either. Somehow, being depressed feels like a failure. I have an highly functioning work life.. But the moment I am alone with my thoughts I break down. It usually stops when I am drained out of my energy and then I feel silly about the whole ordeal. During my episodes, I constantly think about getting some help .. to talk to a professional.. But when that has passed, somehow I just feel that was not a big issue and almost all of us probably depressed and its no reason to go to a doctor.. Any advice would help. Thanks!",0

I think it will just be easier to talk to someone.So today I've been just crying on and off since this morning as I've realized how lonely I actually am. Not to mention I was bullied today at lunch and was physically forced out of my seat. None of my friends stood up for me at all or even asked if I was ok, so I'm pretty sad about that.I've also just been struggling with depression for about a month now. Like I have no motivation to be productive or to get work done. I have so much late work for school that I haven't even looked at yet. So that's giving me a lot of anxiety and stress. My grades are also slipping as I'm starting to fail a lot of my classes; despite being an all A student last year.Having panic attacks and crying have kind of just became a normal things for me; and nobody else knows what I'm going through. I've been also been staying up really late on school nights, just to try and avoid going to school the next day.I suffer from ADD, dyspraxia, and misophonia; so I'm already not that fun to be around. I also feel like I'm kind of boring, or monotonous as I honestly have lost interest in everything. My self esteem and confidence are also really low as of today. So I've really started to truly think about all these things today and I've just been super depressed, and have been crying on/off.

236,"Slasher Flick with some Girl on Girl Action... or inaction? : my husband is going to be disappointed when he finds them. but that was the only thing that felt an option. I haven't cut myself in about 10 or 11 years, but over the last 2 days I've created a pretty big mess of my leg. it just felt so good to be in control of something in me for a change. I've been having daily meltdowns, extreme mood swings for months, and now I am at the psychotic break. I really wish in-patient was a financially realistic option, because I know I am at that point, and need to commit myself for a bit. I just keep trying to survive another day. But my behavior to and around others isn't something I can let slide anymore. I have a ridiculously complicated backstory medically, physically, socially that make me the bundle of fun I am now. I am officially considered to fall under long-term disability because I can only function in a very controlled environment (my house) with out severe vestibular symptoms, and essentially my cognitive abilities to disappear. Over the past 2 months I decided to give in and experience a sexual relationship with another girl. She had been interested in me in years, and I only found out a year ago, when I had a panic attack and said I couldn't do it and was afraid it was her and my husband trying to have an excuse to hookup. So they dropped it, until it came up again in November,  and I said I wanted to try it. My husband supported it, hell he helped orchestrate it. We just had to wait a while for her fiance to get on board.We finally did and I got to experience having sex with another woman... and it was unbelievably amazing.  I always thought I was just bi-curious, but I didn't know if I really felt that way about women or if it was just a kink. Definitely more than just a kink. I want to explore this new side of me so much more. So I desperately wanted to experiment more, I was in this new scary place in my life, and suddenly felt alone in it. She's so much more nonchalant about it. I'm not looking for love, but it was really meaningful to me that it was with her. We're both super bonkers and depressed, and planning her wedding. So we were trying to develop this really close friendship/support system, but also have sex for fun. The sex part is hard to make happen. in 2 months since my first time we've done it 2 1/2 times. She has a lot going on, and she is struggling pretty hardcore with her own depression. we just can't match up. she'll say how desperately she wants to get her hands on me, but the majority of the time our plans don't work out, or if we're together other people are there preventing us from being able to explore more.I don't think she's really that interested anymore, and that she isn't in a place to help me through this sexual identity journey. And I am too emotionally unstable I can't handle rejection after rejection. I want to have this with her so bad, but not at the expense of anybody involved. I just don't know how to end that side of things without breaking her. But if I keep going like this... it won't be good. I've been emptying bottles of wine and liquor, taking extra xanax and my happy pills, nothing helps. I'm trying to get into therapy, but I don't know when that will start, and there isn't an overnight fix.I'm at my wit's end. I have 14 new, nice and long cuts on my body I'm hoping I can keep hiden.but seriously starting again I remembered how easy it was to slash one more, and another, and watch how beautiful the blood looks seeping up through the channels I created for it. I think about suicide all the time, but if I did take my own life it would be a mistake. I know that as much of a burden as I am I can't do that to my husband and parents. And hell, I have so much more in life I want to experience.  I just feel everything crumbling beneath me. I have been intoxicated since like 6:30 pm, and now it's 4:21 am. I took Ambien and fell asleep around 9:30pm, eventually took another Ambien and a glass of wine. I'm exhausted, but I know my brain isn't ready to let me get a break.I just wish I was capable of dealing with my own shit, and moving on. Figuring out how to be just friends again, and be someone she can talk about her mental health issues with. It's just all falling apart and both she and my husband are either annoyed, disappointed, or angry with me (or all of the above). I feel alone, because every time I try to explain why I feel hurt, it's like some joke. Oh she's being crazy again! I don't know what is crazy or sane, or real or an illusion anymore. All I feel is fear, pain, rejection, and embarrassment. If anyone has a magic fix it button,  or the power to tell me to suck it up and that actually work, hit me up! ð",0
237,"Is anyone out there? 22 years old with a life wasted : I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do, there aren't many options. As I write this at 4:30am with tears rolling down my face I realize I have to make a change or I won't make it at all. My depression started at about 19. For the last 2 years my days have consisted of me laying in bed and watching Netflix all day. You might think this is an exaggeration but sadly it is not, I do nothing. I have nobody. I haven't had a friend in years also not exaggerating. I have pretty much zero communication with the outside world. Except when I go to the grocery store or gas station that's about it. I'm 22 years old and I have already wasted 2 years of my life. I am a waste. I am nothing. I don't think I can put in to words how much I truly fucking hate myself. People always say to reach out to friends for help but I HAVE NOBODY. So what the fuck are you supposed to do when you have nobody to help pick up the pieces. I've been trying to make myself go on walks or to the gym or even walk around my house. I reached 4000 steps the other day and was proud of myself. Usually only get less than 1000. I'm conventionally attractive and will sometimes have a fling to make myself feel somewhat better. But I'm a mess. I'd rather be alone. I've gotten so used to this nothingness going out and doing things spark no interest in me. I'm worried I'll end up getting a blood clot in my leg and die or something from not moving and then nobody will find my body and I will rot for weeks while my cats eat me or some shit lol that was morbid. Seriously people of reddit can anyone give me any advice ? I am aware that I am like the biggest waste of space but could there maybe be a place out there for me somewhere?

239,"I keep falling and don't know how to get back up : I tired, really really tired and I don't know what to do. I keep falling and falling everyday to new depths. I'm disappointed in the person I have become and the person I see in the mirror. I'm really depressed and have noone to talk to about it. A little bit of context, I'm African and well in my culture noone believes depression is a real illness, to them you are just lazy or stupid (well not all Africans believe that) so their solution, you just have to get back up and work hard. I didn't know about depression or that I'm depressed, until I was in university and had access to the internet, but by then I was already sucked in deep into the black hole. I can't afford to go to a doctor and have an official diagnosis, but I know myself and I know I'm seriously depressed (if that is how it's said). Bottom line, I'm depressed, not 'kill myself depressed', but I have 'given up and I can't get out of bed depressed.' luckily for me, I have parents who care enough to look after me(I'm 29 by the way, female) even when I'm not working, we are not rich, but doing okay. My brother also has depression, his was so bad, well as bad as mine, but I knew how to hide and pretend, he didn't care anymore, so they took him to a doctor etc, they discovered he had depression(they don't believe it though) but the support us, so they were will to get him on the 3 month anti depressants course his doctor suggested, but my brother did not show any signs of improvement, so my parents decided to stop paying for the expensive medication and they believe that this depression has to do with his personality. So they gave up on him, he is 31 by the way, so he has never worked, got expelled from 1 university and my parents never gave up on him, but now they have completely given up on him. They just let him stay at home and his like a ghost, only gets out of his bedroom to eat, noone notices him anymore, my parents just make sure there is food in the house. I don't want to end up like that, so when I got an opportunity to teach English in China(I procrastinated on it a lot though) I took it last minute, thought I would change, get rich work from myself etc, I have a good business plan, which I formed and planned for this 1 month I was lucid enough to do it. Problem is, I can't really get out of bed, the only reason I can get out of bed is to teach, don't want to lose my job. However, most of the days I'm just in bed day dreaming. I had plans for this year, big plans, and was going to do them slowly, then the coronavirus happened and we have been on lock down. It's now end of February and I have done nothing, have been in bed all along gained 10kgs, I'm now 120kgs, which is bad so bad, the thing is I don't remember what I did the past 2 months. This happens a lot, spend large amounts of time in a haze, I don't even function a lot. I have read all the solutions on fighting depression and anxiety and none seem to work for me, heck I can't even master the will to try them, I want to fight depression without taking medication, but it's not easy. How do you do it? Pleas help! Someone, anyone please help!",0
240,"Study help : Hello, Ive been in a rut recently, I'm sure a lot of you can relate. Because of the coronavirus all in person classes have been suspended and Im stuck at home. I don't have a lot of friends in the first place so I haven't really talked with people my own age either. Ive been feeling pretty bad, but I don't want to visit my counsellor because a) the offices are closed and b) in our last meeting she said something that made me really upset and Im not ready to go back to her. To add on to the loneliness, I'm getting pretty stressed out because my exams are in April and I haven't studied, like at all. Im studying medicine so its a lot of reading and I should really get a start or else I'll have a very hard time. Doing sports/exercise helps, but the high runs out very quickly.I guess I'm just looking for some words of motivation or some stories of success. How do you motivate yourself to be productive? The first step is really the hardest but I'm too tired to push myself.",0
241,"Everything's going downhill, because I feel fucking disgusting. : I don't know where to begin tbh. Started therapy in November 2018. Back then I was suicidal, stayed in bed pretty much all day, everyday. Room was a mess, sleeping pattern and hygiene as well. I couldn't even get myself to get out of bed to brush my fucking teeth. With the help of my therapist things got a bit better over the past year, but now it's like nothing has changed at all. Been thinking about my teeth a lot. They look fucking disgusting, since I didn't care about them at all. Now it holds me back from going out into public, talking to people, smiling, laughing. I've gained weight, too. I've always struggled with my weight, but this is the heaviest I've ever been. I fucking hate myself. I wanted to get better, I swear. After so many years of finding comfort in depression, I finally wanted to get out of this hole, but the decisions I made in the past are fucking haunting me and pulling me back inside. I can't look into a mirror without being disgusted. I don't want anyone to see me like this. So I went back to staying in bed, back to fucked up sleeping patterns and bad hygiene and not talking to anyone. I wish I wasn't such a mess. Such an ugly, disgusting failure.",0
242,"My suicide attempt : I never realized it till now but I should have been hospitalized many times in my past. I have attempted suicide 5 times and failed every. single. time.  With every attempt, I have gotten closer to not waking up but still haven't found the perfect concoction. I usually drink too much wine and then take somewhere between 15-30 pills of over the counter sleeping pills. I started with 10 pills thinking that that would be enough and now I'm up to 30 pills. Next time I'll try 50. The last time I tried, the next day I'm usually very out of it and have a hard time functioning but I usually can make it through the day. I should be going to the ER but I never do because I don't want them to think I'm doing it for attention. So, I just go about my day hoping that nobody will ask too many questions. If I go to the ER for a suicide attempt, I know that I will be put on a 24hr hold to be properly assessed by a mental health professional and I don't want that because I don't want to draw attention to myself. I don't want people to think I'm mentally sick because of the stigmas. I've gotten so much negative feedback anytime I open up to people. They usually tell me to get over it because they think I'm faking it and that my feelings aren't valid. I don't want to be seen as trying to get attention. It would be hard for me to accept that I'm actually sick. I don't think I deserve the help but yet I'm so prepared to kill myself. When is the time to reach out and how do I help myself. I'm so stuck right now. Even after seeing a therapist, I didn't know what to say when I was in therapy so for the most part it was just three 50mins sessions of ya sitting in silence because I couldn't define why I was there. Eventually I just stopped showing up and now I have no hope that there's help for me. The meds I was put on didn't work and I was put on 3 different types...maybe I am making this all up but yet I still would rather just kill myself than live a miserable life that involves me faking all of my emotions because I don't know what they really feel like anymore. It's driving me mad and I think I'm going to attempt a 6th attempt soon. Hopefully this time it will work.",0

245,"I am jealous of people who can get drugs that can numb the pain : I just had a revelation and I need to tell someone. I have had depression since I was 10. My narcissistic dad has been emotionally and physically abusive a long before that. My mom cheating triggered his behaviour. I'm close to 30 now and they are still together. This has made my teenage years hard and naturally due to shitty homelife as a person I was a wreck, which led to me being bullied in school for 10 years. I hated life in school and at home. I almost killed myself when I was 12 but did't because I wanted my little brother to have one person in their life that did't cause him pain. It has been a close call multiple times since that. Currently I live with my boyfriend of 8 years in our own home a happy life. I have been in therapy for 4 years and am currently unempoyed to focus on therapy to get better and he supports it 100%. Seems nice right? I am low contact with my parents but have thought going no contact many times. I do not sleep. I don't think I have ever had a proper good night sleep. I have nightmare seasons (that's what I call them..) and have nightmare every night for weeks. I'm going on 3weeks and 4 nights at the moment, so I have not rested properly during this time. I seek comfort in food and occasionally in alcohol. I have never drank alcohol to party, I drink because I neeeeed a break from my head that keeps telling me to kill myself. I really want to die. I think of it as a dream that I want to achieve. I would love to be freed from this pain that I feel everyday. I have depression, anxiety and PTSD. I am tired. I am writing this because I was watching a documentary about teenagers with drug problems. I related to them so much, their pain is what I feel. The thing that scared me was that I found myself being jealous. I wanted the drugs that would make me numb for a while. I have never tried anything other than alcohol, but I think that if I had had the chance I would have gone that road and I would have killed myself. I would have peace and would be in eternal dream or nightmare, with my luck it would be a nightmare. Luckily I have no way to obtain any sort of drugs, just more therapy. I have so many mixed feelings about life at the moment, the pain seems just too big. On one hand I have an amazing life that could be even better once I get better. On the other hand it seems that I have no power and no strenght in me to be any better. I just would like a few days without the pain, just a little break so I can sleep and gather energy. I feel like this whole text is a mess, I'm sorry.",0

She would always ask me how I'm doing and always smile at me. It's not much but you don't notice that with any other pharmacist. At first I found it odd that she was specifically being really nice to me but now I realize she was probably doing it because she knows I have depression and she wanted to cheer me up. So, to that pharmacist, I wanna thank you for that. You were the only person that interacts with me and it slightly lifts my mood when you treat me like a person. :)",0

PLEASE &amp; i cant stress enough do not comment and tell me to excercise. im not over weight or anything but thats not the solution to pump my endorphins up. i went to the gym and tried various types of things in that realm for over a year and it just made me miserable because i was doing something i didnt wanna do at all and never took a liking. my favorite thing to do is create art and thats what makes me happy but its very hard to do that when your brain basically feels fried out from just basic everyday tasks. how do i get back to loving myself and be happy about things in my life? how do i start a change? i feel so stuck ...my apologizes if this is rambling and incoherent, i just wasnt sure where else to turn for anyone to get it. i just wanna change things and be the best me &amp; im at the point where all i can do is ask for some type of help.",0

253,"A new low : Hi all. I never usually talk about my mental health with anyone but I'm at a point where I feel invisible and just need to put my thoughts into words so I can feel seen, even if nobody replies. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since my teens but have always found some way of distracting myself until now. I was on medication for a short time that made me feel very sick a few years ago but that is the extent of me addressing my mental health medically. In 2014 I was a victim in a violent assault that left me scarred but never really took any steps to deal with that trauma either.I was working in a job that paid my bills but left me very unhappy up until the end of last year when I decided to quit and try to find something that made me want to get up in the morning and do my best. Unfortunately I've not found anything since and the struggle of job hunting has really knocked my self-esteem - especially when I'm turned down for roles with very basic requirements. I can't help but feel unwanted by society at large and I'm only trying to make ends meet at this point.On top of that I had a very loving and supportive boyfriend up until yesterday when he decided to call off our relationship. We've been together for nearly 5 years and I've now lost my most important source of comfort and one of my closest friends.I don't really cry any more but have been weeping on and off for the last 24 hours. I keep telling myself that I am strong and that I've been through so much and will make it through this too but I'm struggling to believe it at the moment. I don't think I've ever been at a point before where everything has collapsed so hard all at once.If you've read this then thank you - I'm so tired of feeling unwanted and irrelevant when I'm just trying to keep going day to day.",0

At the same time, these people who get mad at me for not talking are the same ones who can't aid me, so I feel better just figuring shit out by myself, but coincidentally, that's the most dangerous spot because no one else is there to comfort you and tell you it's alright while you feel like you're worth nothing and deserve to die.I don't know, I'm trying everything but I always come right back here.

266,"Depression ruined my life /vent : This is obviously just a venting post because I can't really tell anyone, no one understands what it's like. I know it's gross but I just feel sorry for myself today.I grew up in a broken family. My dad is a good yet weird human that never expresses feelings and doesn't think psychology or depression is real. Mother abused me in childhood (partially because she was depressed) then left and now she wants to spend time with me because I'm grown up and she hates kids. (same, but I'm not gonna have any!!)I grew up pretty isolated and found much older friends over the internet soon. I was always neurotic, had social and general anxiety since preschool, depression came when I was about 12 and worsened when I moved out to study (14).I'm not gonna call myself a prodigy or a genious lol not at all. Art is the only thing I didn't suck at so I let my anxious brain take over, became very workaholic and was somewhat famous in my country's digital art community for being good at young age. Since I put all of my self-esteem into drawing, I burned out pretty soon after dealing with depression. At 16 I no longer drew. It was and still is so painful to see people who are or were mediocre becoming better than me. Hell to study an art school like this. I've tried to paint again but it will never be the same. I don't love it. At best, I don't mind it. It hurts.I got into uni (game art/illustartion) based only on the shit I painted when I was 13-15. How sad that is?! I can't do anything else and when I don't try to draw it hurts even more.I fall into depression ruts every two months or so when I exhaust myself trying to be ok and functioning because I don't want to get hospitalized. I feel like shit, I didn't progress in life at all these years and I know it's never gonna get better because this is practically my last chance before I have to make serious money to keep my father and cats alive. This is just the tip of the iceburg, of course I have many more fun problems like chronic fatigue, allergy to everything, financial struggles etc but who doesn't. I know it probably doesn't sound that bad but I just can't describe how bad I am feeling - or rather not feeling anymore. I've been so close to killing myself many times, the only thing holding me back is that I have to care for my elderly father and cats and no one else will if I die. I'd fucking ace life by being hardworking if my brain didn't sabotage me from young age. I' m just mad at life. I know a lot of people who are barely trying but will be much more successfull because I'll be dead.Rant over. Thanks for anyone reading, I hope you feel better than I do and if not, hang in there.",0
267,"I guess I don't even know what the title should be : I can't stand 97% of the people I know. I maybe have 3 people that I can talk to. I feel like I don't deserve them but I deserve better friends than others. I talked with this guy a lot. I just wanted to socialize because my family thought it I must. Friends for 8 years. Leaving him to home etc. Wasn't annoying me. It felt like I was just talking. Until last year so. We go to same school with this guy. He hits my head, frequently. I also hit my head pretty hard for 5 or 10 times. I keep hitting my head. I feel like everytime I get hit in head I get dumber. My mental situation changes. I feel like I'm talking to my brain. I think it might be me or not. I want to express those to someone. I want attraction. Do I? I think I'm going too stupid. We argued with this guy today. He hit my head again while I was angry and sleeping. I hit back. I tried to stop myself but only thing I could do was hitting his glasses instead of his face and I don't think I did any damage. I now have a regular pain in my finger. It feels like I'm barely moving it. I slept through the last class. I cried but didn't get my head up. They were arguing about me crying when I was sleeping and nothing happened and the hit came after that. I wasn't crying. I just started to. I have felt like I was talking to my brain and did at least 20 different plans on how to live. I don't think any of them will success because I'm lazy. I feel like my intelligence is dropping. Yes. That's my issue. I think my intelligence is dropping. I talk to my brain every single moment. I sometimes predict something he will say. He claims it's because it's my brain but sometimes I don't even predict it. It just comes out of it. I might be saying that because I want to make myself happy. I guess so? I can't. I can't stand living stupid. I can't stand living stupid because I don't enjoy doing things. Walking, meeting friends. I'm pretty good at making friends in someway I don't even know. I think that made me this shitty. The country is shitty. Can't buy anything. Worst economy. Stupid people. I am stupid. I can understand what's stupid. Those exam questions are stupid. This school is stupid. Teachers are also so stupid. They all say to my parents ""your son is so so so fucking smart and could be the 1st but no, he doesn't want to work hard."" Might be true? No. My mom takes it all serious. My friends call me smart. Some of them not. Some of them do. Some of my teachers think I'm cheating because I get better than his favorite students without even listening to the class. My brain. Feels like I'm going dizzy? I wish I could go all insane. Not have my mind. I would like to die if reincarnating was an option. People here believe Allah. Okay. I barely do. I do believe when I'm stuck. Did I ever think it was so real? I invested through how would we be here. Not an answer. Why would our soul stuck? No meaning. Who the fuck thinks we're all gonna be in afterlife world? I sometimes do actually. I do. Meh. I don't know. Reincarnating is the best option I think I have. I love it. It feels good. It sounds good. I don't know but 10x people died from the current people. I think we also reincarnate as the other beings. I want to be a human. A men. A men that has a white skin tone. I'm not black. I'm actually light-brown or brown. People like to call them terrorists or some shit in the terms of racism. I don't get offended? I think about it. Stop treating your friend like they enjoy it when you enjoy it. That's not true. Please stop. I can't stop thinking about this and no one will read this. Why would they? I can't even speak proper English. I'm worried about if my friends are going to find about this but only 1 person uses it. Literally 1. He is in somewhere where high-iqs go. No one explained to me how would you do this exam. I'm lazy. I'm not going to do all of this questions. I finished the exam in 10 minutes. I knew it was wrong. No one would be bothered to all this. I only remember one part from it. I guess it was the iq test. I was looking at my friend to cheat. I didn't think the way he did. I don't know why did he think that. I also remember the question. It's been a while. I scored higher than all of my people somehow. It was 110. I had no understanding of IQ meant and I didn't even know what was that number. I didn't even know what was that exam. I feel like I never joined in it. We all scored about 105-110. I am just ahead with 2 points. I was cringe. I think I wasn't completely aware of how my brain does. I never thought about it. I was happy. I was really happy. No one was hitting my head. My friends were treating me good. My grades were top. The economy was good. I was good. I was school 1st for one-time. Literally one-time lol. I was able to do all math by my head when I was that age. I guess I still can but I also think I'm stupid. I can't do any of the new math problems. I don't understand my teachers. They just explain and go on. Explaining 5 minutes, solving 35. I remember. I can see how people see me. No, I'm not joking. I can look into anyones eye and see how they see me from perspective. It's scary. It's like looking through a mirror. I can't imagine or can I? I can imagine. I clearly don't remember I imagine. I can. I can't remember. It's only for the time I'm doing it. I am 13 yo. Don't take me seriously. I can't even talk proper English. I don't want anyone I know to find about this. I'm sad. I lied about my age for a while. No one ever suspected me until I told the truth. My friend didn't unfriend me. He's still there. I love him. He thinks I'm smart but it's not the reason I love him. He can understand. Why is it so fucking hard to understand? Why is it so fucking scary to live? I feel like I'm seeing something all-night. I want to play chess. I'm bad at it. One day I get good. Ultra good. I go 300 rating above. Other day I have like 2 missed wins, 10 blunders. I'm calm. I act like I'm not because attraction. I'm an attraction dog. I don't know why am I still typing this but I will go on. I want to type whatever I have. It feels better that way. No one is going to respond though. It will be the saddest part. I now feel like my brain is shitty. When I talk to him he says he is going to repair. He actually said he had it repaired. Since he did. I feel dizzy. I don't sit normally. I can't sit normally. People seem so stupid. At least in my country. What is this? I could make better questions. That doesn't ask anything. This education is bad. If you think it's good, it's bad. If you do good on this, you understand dumb. You  read it. It feels like you're living in it. You read the other, it's bad. It doesn't feel like you're living in it. The answer is 2nd. To the question which asks you which one of those makes you feel live in it. The answer is all because 2-3 stupid words. Quite good. I have to remember all of those useless shit. I won't even use any of them. I don't care. I never did. I won't. I have the big exam after 4 months and I didn't even study a bit for 4 years. I can't. It's boring. Should I? I think I am going to. I will get a PC if I do so. That's the only reason why I have to. My PC is bad. Economy is bad. My parents are not buying one. This one doesn't even have good specs. My dad asks the worker if PC is good and buy it. We can't return it, I know I could get a better one for cheaper. He will be sad. I don't want to get my dad sad. I get angry but I don't want to get anyone sad. I feel sad. I feel bad. I don't think I'm feeling good. The only thing that would motivate me is a brain x-ray. I wonder. I wonder if those hits did anything. I don't know. Did they? I wish they didn't. I'm shy to tell this to my parents. It's stupid. I want to kill myself if they did. I don't want to if they didn't. I don't want to live stupid. I can't laugh at what you laugh at. The fake smile hides it all. I think I'm a clown. I want to change. I can't. It's hard but I keep doing it. I now look at that. I don't even know why did I type this much. Who is going to read that? I don't know. What do I know? Nothing. I'm in a mental loop.",0
268,"I've never been officially diagnosed.... I'm sorry : And I feel ashamed about it, but I also I feel like the people in my life would be ashamed if they knew, and that's what's keeping me from saying anything or getting help.I had two mental health checks when I went to the obgyn a couple years ago. The first was the initial and the second time they had to have a follow up because I answered like I needed help. I lied the second time because my mom asked me about it and I was afraid to talk to her about it.So I stick to toughing it out, trying self care apps, and making secret accounts to vent or use when I'm in a mood.All I can say is that it's not fun to suffer in silence.",0

The only person who knows is my mom and doctor but I have to talk to my friends and girlfriend about it but I just cant bring myself to tell them so when it happens i get all angry because that is how I cope with it but also it hurts me so bad and all I want to do is just lie on the ground and just cry but I have to keep going and keep pushing through because I have to many responsibilities to just stop doing everything. And i constantly want to die but I keep thinking about my mom and girlfriend and friends. So basically in order to talk about it I say that I am having ""Brain Fog"" which is basically something I made up in order for my friends to sort of understand and sympathize with me.

271,"Depression &amp; Spiraling Thoughts : A little about me...I am a 34 year old female. I used to be a gym rat, working out 6 days a week, taught a class even, I'm a musician, an insurance broker, crazy cat lady and love cleaning...December 2018 I made the decision to leave my husband of 7 years because we simply weren't seeing eye to eye anymore. I started dating someone very shortly after that. I moved into my own place, traded in my car, and then started to get into some financial trouble. Balancing these things all hit me at once. I stopped going to the gym, couldn't even imagine playing my guitar or my piano, the sight of a dish in the sink would throw me into a panic attack...""I have to wash two plates AND fold clothes, *OMG, how*."".....My dad, over the course of a year, has given me a total of $10k to pay off debts and just generally pay bills ($4k last summer and 6k recently). Out of nowhere, I spiraled into a depression. I've had some pretty bad anxiety for awhile, but as soon as he gave me that second loan, I spiraled out of control with guilt, which quickly turned into a severe depression/anxiety. I have already gone through my 2 weeks of PTO (and more). I can't go to work because I feel like I have the flu all the time, and now I'm scared of being able to able to pay back the loan, make rent, etc. Every day of work I missed just made me feel worse, but the thought of going made me crazy. ""*What is happening to me? Everyone is mad at me, I'm such a disappointment"".*Every day is a struggle for me. I love my boyfriend, but I feel like my depression is pushing him away, my co-workers are mad at me, and you sure learn quick who your real friends are during a major life change.  I've lost several ""friends"" over the past year, and obviously my ex in-laws are all upset with me - understandable since I was the initiator of the divorce. I also had to leave two cats behind which were my world (sounds silly, but they were). Basically, the guilt just eats away at me. I am one of those people that can't stand the thought of people being mad at me or not like me. I cannot just brush it off or say screw it. I care ***too*** much what people think. People that don't even matter to me or have no significance in my life. I think *way* too hard into the future, and worry about everything that hasn't even happened yet. ""It's like I'm trying to control, and protect my future self from getting hurt somehow but I don't even know what those things are. So much so that this why I've been missing work because I was so anxious and depressed that I could not fathom eating, which was making me sick...I can't go to work, can't pay my bills, will get kicked out of my place, my boyfriend will move on, will lose my car, will have to move back in with my parents, and be lonely, sick and sad forever. I will just be known as that ""sick girl"". This is the way my mind spirals out of control on a daily basis. I've seen a psychiatrist, a therapist, had multiple visits with my doctor, so now the doctors bills are going to start piling on top of it. Currently I am taking 50mg of Zoloft, which has been beneficial to me in the past (roughly 2014), but I stupidly decided to ween myself off of it around the same time I started going through a divorce. Like I wanted to prove to myself I could handle all of this on my own without the use of medications. *Wrong.* I was also taking around 10mg of Ambien every night for sleep and it worked great for me. I had no side effects whatsoever. However, I started to run out way to early. I was sleeping a lot and napping so I'd break them into pieces to take naps. The doctor became alerted to this during our last visit and refused to refill it for me, which of course, sent me into a literal tailspin and severe panic. I was throwing up when I left the office because I was so distraught (and still hadn't eaten). My mind went reeling thinking ""how am I going to function and handle all of this stress if I can't ever sleep, how can I work?"" Literally thinking I would die eventually from exhaustion and depression. My psychiatrist then prescribed me 15mg of Remeron, which seems to have been working ok but it's just not the same. I hate starting new medications. I went through all the classic symptoms, sadness, anger, etc. My parents, boyfriend's parents, my siblings, boyfriend, all started to become worried and concerned for me which made me feel worse. I just feel like I'm going to ""run out of time"" as I keep saying. Basically, that everyone around me is going to abandon me before I have a chance to heal.This week, I'm back at work and have been sleeping somewhat better and doing my best to stay positive and just focus on work, pushing past the feelings and just trying to enjoy my life day by day instead of trying to fix everything. Of course, my mind is still reeling and I'm still not feeling great, but taking baby steps. Does anyone relate to any of this? Thanks",0

I have no friends, and the only woman I ever loved is half way across the country getting married to the guy she left with. I am trapped in the city I grew up in and I hate it here. It seems like this is the worst possible version of my life. Like I'm being punished for something I did in another life. I just want to feel again.

274,"feeling numb and everything seems hopeless : I'm in college and technically a sophomore because I took a semester off after having my first big spiral and being diagnosed with depression. I used to stay in my dorm room isolated and not getting out of bed let alone go to class.

275,"Why am I having these thoughts and feeling this way : I dont know exactly which sub I should go to so I'm posting here. I'm 21 and I have a great life. Amazing, supportive and loving family and friends, no physical health issues, I'm in community college and I'm doing great with my grades and major. The only thing thats holding me back and making me feel like I'm struggling is my mental state. The main things that are bothering me are why I feel like I cant find meaning in life and why I always worry so much. A couple weeks before christmas I just started getting these thoughts and feelings out of the blue about why anything mattered, and what's the point to life. I also have always had anxiety, so that combined with my thoughts have made me fearful that I'm just going to try to kill myself. I never have planned it or remotely considered doing it, I was just fearful of what I might do in the future if that makes sense, thinking worst case scenario. Everywhere I go now I cant seem to shake these almost obsessive thoughts about whether or not I'll lose my mind and crash my car or try to hurt myself. I also feel like I cant find the same pleasure as I did before. Nothing looks as stunning, emotions aren't as strong as before, that kind of thing. I'm also lacking motivation somewhat. I dont feel tired, hopeless, have a reduced appetite, have trouble sleeping though. I dont know how to fix how I feel and what I'm thinking. I've tried going for runs outside, eating healthier and reading articles about how to find purpose and gain back my interest in life but it's not helping all that much. I do know for a fact though that ever since I started watching porn when I was younger, I started having social anxiety, mild OCD, reduced pleasure in everything and depression. I feel like a little bit of that has gone away, but my brain still feels off. Ever since I quit watching, I would have moments where I would wonder what it would be like to just die because of these symptoms that I've been having ever since I watched porn. I would go places and experience things afterwards, but those experiences never were amazing and made me feel happy in the same way that I used to feel when I was a lot younger. Just recently, I cant do anything really without wondering what's the means and purpose behind what I'm doing. I wish I could just go back to years ago when I was younger, and never had any of these crazy and existential thoughts. I wish my brain go to back normal, as I'm tired of dealing with these thoughts and feelings. I guess what I'm asking is, what do I blame here for how I feel and how can I start to fix it? How do I communicate about my struggles? Also, any advice on how you can get back your purpose and meaning in life. I truly just want to feel better. Thanks.",0
276,"Stopping medication after many years - Words of advice : I am 22 years old. 2 months ago, I started the slow process of getting off the 125mg of sertraline I have been consistently taking for 2 years (really slowly got up to that amount). I tried two different kind of anti-depressant before that one but I was so young there's no point discussing them. I sacrified a lot to have access to those pills. I was grateful for them and happy to raise the dosage when my doctor felt it was needed.The pills granted me a pause from my brain. I was able to go to school, earn my degree, work while studying. My mother was happy. I seemed okay. My libido was absolutely annihilated. I was doing okay.""Okay"" obliviously isn't good enough after 5 years, trying to start your career as an artist. So recently I made a huge decision, the scariest of my life so far. As a result, I am deep into this feeling of emptiness you are left with when you remove something that found its place in you for so long.I am sure I am not alone going through this.I thought I was strong enough to go through with it, to finally find my personnality, my sexuality, my real emotions. To make art.But everything feels wrong. Unsurprisingly.People keep telling me to just ""Do your yoga!"" ""Pet your cat!"" ""Go volounteer like you did!"" but nothing feels right anymore. The only voice in my head is the one I had all my life before medication. I feel like I didn't take enough time to understand that voice. My psychologists and phychiatrists didn't. My trips to the mental hospital didn't. I should have listened to this voice all this time and instead of ignoring it, I should have tried to change its patterns, I should have tried to silence it myself. I ran away from a problem and it came to bite me in the ass after years and thousands of dollars wasted on false hope of being ""saved from myself"". Professionals have their limits, I shouldn't have put my trust into them. I was so young. I am still so young.Depression isn't something you fix with pills. My uncle can't get off his meds without feeling like shit, I can't either. But feeling like shit is part of life apparently. I have to go through that, apparently. I chose not to using the ""easy way"", persuaded by my doctor, family, friends, society, science, progress, even in the name of ""life finds a way, no matter how wrong it feels"". Depression isn't something you fix going the easy route, and since there's no real easy route anyway, we are left dealing with it the only way we know: following well-meaning advice, just like I did.Don't feel bad for feeling bad, you need this. It's a sign something is wrong. The ""check engine"" is lit up. It's because you know something is wrong, and there's nothing really wrong with that. But it also means its time to DO something. And yes, pills are useful, but please be careful. Withdrawal is real for me, there is absolutely nothing keeping me alive besides guilt because of this right now. I am not saying this to discourage anyone from making the right decision for themselves. I am not the best advice giver, but neither were anyone else when it came to saving myself, which is why I am choosing to share this with you.",0
277,"Depression causing crisis in family- Not sure how to feel right now : Hi, my name is Chance. I'm 42 years old, married (to a man, I'm gay) and have two children a daughter 14, and a son 12. My daughter has severe Autism, is verbal but has the mental capacity of a 5 year old. She is partially potty trained, still wears pulls ups, and has increasingly violent and destructive melt downs. I see counseling, am on depression meds, and my daughter has a therapist, goes to a school for MRDD, and had medications for her behaviors though I don't feel they help much. With her behaviors and the stress I'm under I have been having more and more issues with my depression. There are days when I simply can't function anymore. I do the best that I can, my kids are clean, have clean clothes, are well fed, and there has never been any issues of abuse or neglect. They are, for the most part, happy. My son has some resentment towards his sister and between him and my husband and myself her behaviors has caused some stress in our family. I recently had a break down where I was threatening suicide, was arrested and placed in a cell for what I am assuming was for suicide watch. It was just a room with a grate in the floor that was to be used as a toilet, no furniture, I was stripped naked, and given only a blanket. I was there for 24 hours then released but other issues arose from that situation. The police called CPS and due to my house being a mess and unsanitary the children have been temporarily placed in my mothers care. I'm working with CPS as well as some other agencies to clean the house and get some help for the current situation.  We've actually got a lot done, and I am doing my best to get the kids returned. The last thing I want to do is have my daughter placed in a residential facility for autistic children but that may end up being where this leads. For years I have been trying to get help. I've looked into respite care, I've explored every avenue I can think of, I have taken advantage of every service and agency that I know about. Places like the YMCA and other similar programs wont take my daughter for their respite programs or after school programs because of her incontinence and behaviors. At this point I'm just at a loss. I've discussed this all with my mom many many times, I've told her about my troubles, about my daughters behaviors, and mom has continuously swept my concerns under the rug.  She has told me that I need to just stop being depressed and take care of my family and there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to. This is basically what I get every-time I ask for help.  Now that she has had the kids for the past week, she is calling me everyday, several times a day, complaining about my daughter. My daughter screams and throws tantrums, kicks, hit, throws things, knocks over furniture etc... Mom is saying that she just can't take it anymore and that something needs to be done. She's constantly telling me that I need to get the kids back. I told her that I am doing everything I can, that it's up to CPS at this point and I am cooperating fully with them. At this point I don't know what else to do. I'm trying to get the house cleaned, going to court, going to my therapist, and helping my mom as much as I am allowed with the children. I'm just at a loss and worse, I'm starting to get angry with my mother. I don't see how she can so easily dismiss my concerns for years, and then after one week keep complaining to me about what my daughter is doing. She says she feels like she has no life, shes starting to resent my daughter, she is upset that she has to constantly change diapers (pull ups) and she just can't handle it anymore. Valid points all but at the same time, I've been dealing with this for years, not a week, and she never seemed that concerned with my problems. She's now attempting to get respite care and is facing the same issues that I have faced in the past and so shes been calling me wanting me to look into it more, talk to people, talk to CPS, and then gets upset with me when I don't deliver. I'm honestly trying my best, I've her ideas and tips on how to deal with the behaviors but she says she doesn't have the time or energy to devote that much one on one time with my daughter. I told her that it's all part of caring for an autistic child, it's 24/7 not just when you feel up to it. I'd think by now she would understand my depression, and my problems with house cleaning, caring for my daughter, and trying to maintain a healthy family but it just seems like every time something goes wrong she blames me for it. I know that I messed up, I am at fault for what happened, but all I have ever been trying to do is ask for help from anyone. It seems like no one really cared about what was going on until the authorities were involved and everyone is saying they want to help, they want to get a care plan in place, they want to do this and that, but at the same time I feel like the bad guy here, and no one really understands what I've been going through or why I allowed things to get this bad. Sorry for the long post, I just really don't have a lot of people to talk to and needed to get some of this off my chest. Thanks to anyone who reads and comments. Take care and stay safe :)",0

280,"I'm so infinitely bored : I suffered from depression for a few years and when I finally got ""better"" I realized I'm not interested in anything anymore. Like I only do stuff that I'm forced to do. I go to work, I go to college, I study for my exams, I cook and clean and shower, I help my parents and my sister and my friends when they need me, but that's that. When I'm alone and have some free time on my hands I do nothing or waste my time on the internet. I stopped loving books and music, I can't sit through a single movie, I don't play instruments or do crafts or write or whatever hobbies I used to have. I don't have any life outside of what other people or circumstances impose on me, and I can't force myself to do anything unless someone else expects some results from me.",0

282,"I got fired from my parents resteraunt and then got arrested last weekend : Valentines day is a bad memory for me, so i really just wanted to get drunk. I blew off a direct order from my step dad, and did it my way so i could go get drunk sooner. He fired me, and i ended up drinking more than i would have. I drank about a gallon of vodka over the course of two nights and even did coke. The morning that i got arrested i was sitting on the edge of my friends bathtub, trying not to get sick. Once i felt better, i started drinking again. My friend asked me to leave because i was sitting on the couch and he wanted the space to lie down. And i didnt care what happened to me so i did. I got pulled over and blew a .16, double the legal limit. Im 20. I got off so lucky, he didnt give me a dui, i got charged with minor in possession of alcohol and paraphernalia (weed pipe)All i could think about was that i deserved it. I let my depression get the best of me, and i was drinking at least 3 times a week. I knew it was getting out of hand, but i didnt realize the extent until i got busted and was left in the drunk tank to think about my actions. Im restructuring my life. Cutting out people in my life that rely on weed every day, and trying to be more proactive about my life. I feel like i let everyone down.

I have lost a desire to go to the gym, which previously, I had done without a problem. My medication (Buproprion) is not helping at all, instead, it makes me lose my appetite which further makes me feel crappy.I only work twice weekly due to family insurance since we are all on the same insurance and need to make a certain amount of income to have it.

286,"Is it my fault? : Little backstory first.I am a 16 year old male.  Go to a career school.  Have a girlfriend.  Set boundaries with my girlfriend as soon as we decided to go from friends to a relationship.  Been together for 7 (almost 8) months.  I have a bad past with relationships (Being cheated on, getting lied to, etc.).  I have a history with depression, anxiety, and self harm due to family issues and these horrible past relationships.  My family just laughs at me when I tell them how I feel and my girlfriend doesn't like me talking about it.Story:One of the boundaries we set was that we wouldn't drink (Mostly due to her making bad decisions in the past while drunk).  We had both agreed and promised on it.  Was fairly easy for me to comply with considering I don't drink or use drugs of any sort.  Recently she was working at an undisclosed fast food chain restaurant.  She has been working there for 6 months and nothing has happened to cause me to raise an eyebrow.  Recently, she was waiting to get off of work.  Sitting with her manager and two of her co-workers. (All guys)  Okay cool ya know, just chilling waiting for the clock to strike quitting time.  Well I asked her if everything was okay because she sent me a picture of herself on snapchat and she looked kind of out of it.  She said, ""Yes baby i promise everything is okay"".  Okay, no reason to be worried right? Wrong.  Once she was home she called me and confessed that she drank alcohol with her male co-workers and then proceeded to lie about it for about an hour.  It wasn't even the drinking part that bothered me.  She could've just said ""hey i had a drink tonight at work"".  But she lied about it.  And now she wonders why I don't trust her.  I get anxious every time she goes into work, wondering what else might be going on, hidden behind lies (mostly worried about cheating considering she works with mostly guys who are very attractive, even to me, a straight male).  She gets angry whenever I mention that I'm anxious or sad and thinks the trust should've came back just after two weeks.  I am not a perfect boyfriend by any means, but I always tell her the truth if I mess up.  So am I the one at fault here? Because she really makes me feel like I am.",0
287,"Long stream of depressed consciousness. I've been living with these thoughts all my life and I think they will be with me until I die. : I grew up in an extremely abusive household. I can't overemphasize that. My family were refugees and my grandfather in particular was a literal war criminal.I grew up in a violent, horrifying home. I was terrified and deeply depressed. In school I could not smile and play. I made no friends. I was bullied until I became the quiet creepy kid who people left alone.I never connected with anyone. I failed out of school and laid down in my room to die for years. But I never died. I'm still here. I've cleaned my life up a little. I have a job and I live in my own apartment.I disowned my family. But I am deeply unhappy and negative. No medication or therapy changes that. And I've been taking meds and seeing therapists for 15 years now.I am a miserable and unhappy person. Few people want to date me or by my friends, and those who do are toxic and deeply disturbed themselves.I want to die. I have no hope that anything will change. I will continue to be alone and unhappy until I die.I enjoy nothing. I don't enjoy TV or music. I play a lot of podcasts, but I don't really enjoy them either. Having people talk in the background sometimes keeps me from thinking as much. Less chance that I fall into a pit of depression and suicidal thought.I don't even want to be happy. I want to end.If I had a genie and I could wish for anything, I wouldn't wish for money or love or happiness. I would wish that I had never been born.I've had thoughts like these my entire life. They don't go away. And when I look around me at the world it all seems justified. Climate deniers are in power. We're slowly marching toward preventable disaster. I can't convince myself that humanity is good and I'm wrong for being so negative.I think maybe if more people were cynical they wouldn't have just said everything will be okay and let the world reach the state it is in now. Maybe a little cynicism is what humanity needed to steer a better course.Above all, I feel it's too late. I think we're all doomed and I will live a sad, lonely life until my dog dies. Then I'll kill myself and the decades long misery will end forever.Go ahead. Laugh and downvote away. I'm used to being ridiculed or threatened with hospitalization if I open up and express what I actually feel inside.I think one day those people who laugh or treat me like I'm sick will have to face the reality that I am living through. I think when civilization comes apart at the seams and half the world is burning there are going to be more people like me than not.I know this is repetitive and long. It's a stream of consciousness and it's been running on repeat in my mind since I woke up.",0
288,"Recently started seeing a therapist : As the post says, I've started seeing a therapist for about a month now (seen her 2 times) I've been taking anti-depressants since July '19, but they stopped working in early September. I don't really remember them working really, but I've had some things happen from ALOT of family problems, getting in a fire, suffering horribly from anxiety at times paranoia and hallucinations (about once or twice every other day), depression, recently around the past 2-3 weeks I've been having panic attacks daily.. (3-4 a day but it can be up to 6 some days), when I sleep I never get rest as I wake up multiple times a night because i have breakouts from my Rhynauds, I sleep for around 17-18 hours on average, the past 4 or 5 months i have nightmares everytime I close my eyes so I'm scared to initially fall asleep.. so I just stay awake as long as possible until my brain just is like ""time to shut down now"".. I've lost 13ish pounds since October 31st, which makes me 122 pounds at an age of 19. I want to change myself, and my life but my feet are in so much pain I can't walk so much and doctors don't really have anything they can so for it. The biggest problem with depression I hate it how i have no emotions towards anything and when I do it's negitive. The holidays + January have been absolute hell. My mum canceled Christmas &amp; Thanksgiving and then put it back on just so my older sister doesn't find out how mentally ill she is. She's very bad off and takes medicine and she has been doing better this month but still has bad days, I have not.. a few weeks ago I woke up to hearing a gun shot like sound waking up in a panic thinking ""Oh my god, MOMMA!!"" I woke up to surprise she didn't do that.. but she did throw the table across the room, and was cutting herself, over dosing, and nearing the edge of actually killing herself. I'm constantly scared. I don't think I will kill myself only because i am to scared to fail, so.. I don't know where I'm going with this, I just want to stop living life with this ""grey filter"" and want to be the happy old me who did things besides leaving the house once every few months. I'm hoping this therapist helps. Thank you for reading if you've made it this far, have a great day.. :)",0

That would be perfect because I could pay my bills and still have a little bit left over each month. I still haven't been a paid a living allowance, and thus when I called them; they told me that I was given the WRONG information... and that it was all in a lump sum. So now, I've paid my bills... and according to them, $1,000 is enough to live on for 4 months at a time.

291,"Therapy : I have been having some adverse reactions towards my therapist lately. In December we took a break from our relationship because we both had things to do. When I came back I was really anxious. I had never been so anxious seeing her. I thought that the anxiety would go away but it always come back. Whether I call to schedule an appointment with her, think about my appointment with her the night before my appointment, or while waiting for my appointment in the lobby, during our sessions and after my anxiety ramps up. My last session with her my voice was shaking. She told me that she is concerned for me and that she wants me to feel free to talk about anything. I don't really know where this is coming from. I was expecting the anxiety to go away by now. I become so anxious that others notice at work and that I become nauseous. Maybe it's the fear that the relationship could work out or maybe it's the fear that it won't work out. I kind of just use her as a sounding board at the moment. It bothers me to my core that I have to pay someone just to listen to me because I have been quiet for too long. The things that she tells me are basic.  We have tried meditation but I had this fear that she was going to rob me. We tried book work but we both became distracted and now we don't know where to start with that. We practice assertiveness and I'm doing okay with that. Sometimes I don't think that I need her and that I'm wasting my money. Sometimes I think it would be better if I just said that it isn't working out.",0

Past two years I struggled mostly with the lack of emotion. Thanks (?) to antidepressants, I don't get horny a lot, but orgasms feel nice so I'm getting myself off on occasion. It's really efficient against headaches, too, you know.But what puzzles me is that sometimes during actual climax and just for a second or two, I feel whole. Like I'm back in my body and everything is solid and real. It's hard to describe. The fog is gone, I'm in control again.Has anyone experienced something similar?

295,"Wanna know something funny? : When I was 15 I tried to take my life by overdosing on Prozac. (To be ironic I guess, and because it was the least painful method I had access to). Long story short, it didn't work. I didn't even have to get my stomach pumped, or drink charcoal, which made me feel like a big fucking moron. The way I was treated at the hospital was absolutely atrocious. I won't even get into it, but let's just say I finally realized and understood just how little I matter to the world. Two years later, and I still believed that I suffered no permanent injuries or whatever from my attempt. But this past New Year's Eve, my mother let my sister drink a glass of champagne (she's 20). I asked her if I could have one as well and she said no. She then proceeded to tell me that my suicide attempt fucked up my liver so bad that drinking was out of the question for me. It makes sense, considering my recent blood test results have weird, usually concerning results on them that my doctor ignored, as she knows about my attempt. I am so fucking pissed off. You're telling me that I can't even drink to forget or I'll die from liver failure? (Which is not something I'm trying to do. It sounds long and painful). Fuck this dude. Fuck this.

296,"Getting off of antidepressants? : I was on lexapro for 2 years due to depression and it worked for a long time. But now, I'm not depressed anymore and recently lexapro has just made it hard for me to think straight and given me a drunk feeling. I tried to quit cold turkey, which was probably stupid. I went about a week and a half without it which felt like an eternity because the withdrawal symptoms were horrible. I was throwing up everyday, my heart was racing, I was lightheaded, my mouth was extremely dry, I had flu like symptoms etc. weirdly despite all of this though, I felt a lot better mentally off of it.Eventually it became unbearable so now I'm on a low dose of prozac and not having withdrawals anymore. The thing is, prozac gives me the same unmotivated, drunk feeling as lexapro and I don't want to be on either.I'm taking 10mg prozac right now and don't know how to go about getting off of it or tapering.Does anyone have any advice or personal experience? anything is appreciated loli hate doctors",0

300,"A bad day? A depressive episode? An overreaction? I don't know anymore. : First I would like to say I'm currently diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety, and since 2016 I am taking 30mg of Lexapro (generic). So, a friend and I had been watching a TV show together and last week we watched the final episode. The show itself was dark and emotional, and the last episode was especially emotional because it implied that the main characters had died (they didn't). I felt a bit off afterwards but I just thought it was a normal reaction to finishing a show I liked.The next day I woke up feeling okay-ish, but as the day went on, I became more and more upset and distressed. I started obsessing over the TV show thinking ""What if they really died?"" and I couldn't stop fixating on it, even though there was proof I was wrong. And even though there was positive things to think about that happened in the show, I didn't care about them, I just focused on everything negative. I began to lose interest in things, things I liked to do or anything else. I didn't want to listen to music, I didn't want to play games or watch videos. I didn't feel like smiling or laughing. I didn't want to eat or drink anything. Everything felt like too much effort. Sometimes I would just stare at the wall and cry because I felt so hopeless. I didn't want to do anything but lay in bed and agonize and obsess over that stupid TV show, my brain just pumping out sad or upsetting ""what if, what if, what if"" questions. This lasted for 4-5 days. I felt so stupid and dumb, like ""Why are you this upset over something like this?"". I felt stupid going to the doctor and talking to my therapist about it. My therapist suggested that maybe I've had a build up of stress over the past months and the TV show was what triggered it, and I asked ""Well if that's the case, then why did I just focus and obsess so much on the TV show and nothing else? Why not on the other things in my life?"" and she didn't know. My therapist and mom would say things like ""Well it didn't last that long this time"" and ""Even on medication you'll still have down days"" and I'm just confused and frustrated. So, that's all it is? Was what I went through just a bad day? Is that normal? I have to go through something like that again? I can't watch a damn TV show I like in case something like this happens again?It didn't feel like a normal reaction, I felt horrible, I didn't feel like myself. But still I wonder if I'm just overreacting about this whole thing. I hadn't had a bad episode in a long time, and I do have a tendency to get obsessed with things that I like. Maybe it wasn't depression, maybe I'm just a sensitive person, maybe this is just something I have to deal with and get used to. I'm just really scared, I don't want to go through that again, and I'm scared that there's nothing that can help me or prevent this from happening again.",0

303,"Tragedy of depression and unknown psychologically âdiseasesâ?: Hey reddit users Iâm writing this, because I know that my time in this world will be over soon. I never really had a good binding to this world so thatâs why it wonât be hard for me to do it, at least thatâs what Iâm hoping. Iâm a 19 year old guy from germany (don't judge my english please) living in a time where society has two sides for people. One side is basically bad and the other cares. But this really depends on who you are. Iâm not writing this text to get attention, because why would I need attention If I die anyway? I know that society depends on experience but one side that reads this will think excactly what I said and the other might care about it. The inaquality of people is what makes this world such a bad place. I tried many years to find my way through it and through what I am. One of those things is that I know what empathy is but I can't feel it. Like many âPsychologicallyâ?kids I was send to psychiastry some years ago by my parents but only had to stay there three weeks. I noticed soon that I don't get the help I need and the only thing I got was medicine I didn't want. I was in one of these rooms next to the big eating table under investigation for the reasons I was send there. The door was locked the whole day and I only got out to eat what I hated. Every evening I layed my head on the table in my room and begged my parents to get me out but they didnt. I don't like society that much. Why do I need to confront social anxiety when I only want the pain to be gone. Whatâs paradox is that I would consider myself a good friend, because I always care for my friends problems even though I don't like people. Itâs just the experience I got with them. I don't have the kind of friends I can talk to. Otherwise I wonât write this but I want to know what I have before I go. It feels like being hated by a god you don't believe in. I always believed in the devil even If there canât be one without the other. I wish I could be independent from society or have someone on my side of view to help me out to bloom. Or just give me the ability to wear another mask the whole day so I can hide my difference better so I don't have to do this. I don't have a fixed date yet, because at the moment (since 1/2 year) I found someone similar to me. The big problem is Iâm not able to talk to her, because she's introverted. I tried at the beginning but she didn't even respond to my text message when I introduced her to the chat of our class group. I kinda feel responsable for her, because I like her much even though I don't know her well. But sheâs a perfect example for what else can happen to you. While others hate her because of her kind I want the best for her and I think the best for her will be me, leaving her alone. Sheâs the one kind of hope I have in life. I think that everything is easier together. But not together like a group. I mean together like a binding between two persons. Call it love or how you want but I call it hope. But she also came with a negative side like the fact that she leaves our school now. Since I know her I feel even worser than before. At night I stay awake even longer to think and my pain got worse to a degree where itâs untenable. My mind even created a eating disease for me. I never ate much but now I have this pain everytime I ate something and after I have to go to the toilet and my body just doesn't accept me to concentrate in school or to eat which is one reason I hate to eat with others. It feels like my body already accepted to be turned off soon. To the kind of people I try to call friends I said that I have a eating disease and a scar in my stomach which I will die from. This should make it easier for me to go. Well I didn't tell everyone of my friends. I guess I can say that I have around 3/4 âokâ?friends and I told three of them. With this text I want to get something to say in this cruel world too. I want to know what I have and I want to thank the girl I was talking about for giving me the ability to stay a bit longer. Also there is a girl on Instagram I really really like. But only as a person. Her name is Dasha Taran. I like the way she lives her life. When you look at her you get a comfortable feeling, like listening to one of Billie Eilishâs or Edenâs songs. The best thing about her is that she doesn't show pictures like most of the girls do nowadays. She doesn't need to show her whole body like others do and on her pictures she smiles you straight in the face. Thats something you don't see often nowadays. There is too much fake out there. Is it a fake smile you have to put on for others or a fake life you life to impress others. The last of my days I will try to find an answer for my problem either in form of sleeping pills or a person I can talk to about everything I want to, because I left many things out.

I've been in different medications which is a struggle to find what works right now I have very little energy and my therapist that i have been seeing recently only gives me these modules on self esteem and anxiety and Just listens to me to talk for an hour and I don't see how that's supposed to help. I have missed a lot of my classes and midterms because I just feel so mentally and physically drained. How am i supposed to make up for all the missed work. My professors are understanding and all but I'm scared. I just don't know what to do, it feels all so impossible right now.

306,"ð¼TWð¼ Self Harm Mention : Hey... So.. I'm just posting this to let out stuff rn. Things have been rocky since switching around medication (for the FOURTH) time and I started new birth control so that's really not helping the depression. And as of lately idk why but with all the stress and nasty feelings I've been more depressed and it flares up abandonment issues. Yes I've gone to therapy, I have my next appointment the 28th and I'm going to a psych March 9. Sometimes I ask myself if I can last that long to even be able to sit down and be able to even start getting more of the help I need because I just wanna cave. It's not like my life is horrible either... I have an amaZing boyfriend that I know I'll spend the rest of my life with. I'm in college and yeah it's hard but at least I'm here. I'm in a sorority. I have a job at my university too. But it's just not enough to have like an okay life and be just okay. I haven't been near just okay in a couple weeks. I've relapsed and self harmed multiple times within the past couple days and I feel the urge again. It gets worse anytime those little abandonment issues come up. Do I wanna get into detail? Not really. All I will say is due to circumstances in life I will sometimes get these episodes of dread (gotta love the GAD/Panic Disorder too!!!) and feel like everyone's gonna leave. Like my boyfriend will leave like the others did even though he has given me NO reason whatsoever. The opposing, actually... He left for work and those feelings hit me and I lost it and I'm typing this so I can keep my hands busy and not actually relapse more. I wanna do it so bad. The pain gives me that sense of control; I can't control when someone goes away forever (this is my brain during all the big stuff oh boy) but I can control the fact that I can inflict pain on myself or choose not to. I end up wanting to more than anything. I can't help but feel irrationally alone and it makes me even more depressed... Also I'm sorry that this may not make sense. My head's everywhere I'm everywhere right now. I just hate how this is all a freaking endless loop too. Thanks for sitting through this if you did ð Blessed be ð",0
307,"February 22nd 2020 : I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I'm not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must've subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn't tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn't die but I wanted to come closeâ?I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would've been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don't think this will be the last time I do this. I just don't feel much except weariness anymore and I'm tired. To anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance, thank you for being there for me :)",0
308,"(23F) Separated from husband with 50/50 custody of 2 year old : I suffered pretty bad from PPD after having my son. It didn't help that my husband was toxic and had his own problems. Now we're on better terms but separated and he's paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it's awesome. But 95% of the time it's me and half of the week it's my son and I. I've been eating right and exercising daily for the past month and a half, feeling so good about myself. Yesterday I got my son back and was so happy. I meal prepped in the kitchen with fun music while simultaneously playing with my kiddo. A really amazing day. Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that's wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he's here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I'll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can't do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven't done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn't fully furnished. I type that and think I'm just lazy. But holy hell, I took my son to the museum today and that was the biggest feat I think I've ever pulled. Just making that move to get out of bed, get myself dressed, get him dressed, leave the house... now I feel so heavy. My head actually feels pressure pushing me down. I don't want to do anything. I had a three day streak where I didn't brush my teeth or my hair, and that's still while dieting and exercising. I think I am always depressed, but on some days I can do more things than others and distract myself. Anyway. Meeting my STB ex tonight with my stepkids for a show. Another thing that I have to force myself to do without thinking of vomiting.",0

I am a long time lurker of this sub but haven't posted before.I have struggled with chronic depression/anxiety since childhood and have been in therapy off and on over the many years. I have trouble maintaining relationships, leaving the house, and have not been able to hold a job more than 3 months in quite some time. I do have a loving, supportive partner. These past few months have been significantly worse. I have had suicidal thoughts, have been self harming with greater intensity, and need help with basic tasks because I have no energy/motivation despite sleeping all day. I have pretty intense panic attacks. Sometimes I feel like there are two different Mes... the me who wants to die, pull my hair out, make myself bleed, and can't control my extreme emotions. Then there is the regular me, who can type out this post and even go on walks outside with the encouragement of my partner, and look at the water and think about how beautiful the world can be.Anyway... I am in a new country and have restarted a new medication. I also start with a new therapist today. I am so scared. What if they think I am faking it? What if they laugh? What if they say they can't help me? Or, I saw a crime documentary on a crazy therapist who blackmailed her patients to commit crimes. What if my therapist is crazy?Looking for encouragement or advice from people who understand my situation.

310,"Life is a biiiittttcchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh : A few years ago, nothing in the world could make me cry. And even though I was depressed, I could still handle it. I had control over my emotions. Now I'm also on birth control (for health reasons) and my depression either makes me feel ânormalâ?some days or it just makes me want to ignore everyone and disappear. I'm always SOOOOO moody. The moody part is a hell lot worse when I do get on my period. I become extremely emotional for NO reason. The littlest things make me cry. I talked to my doctor about it and she said that it's normal. That they're just side effects and it's different for everyone. The two medications make it worse because antidepressants are meant to help me fight depression, but birth control's side effect IS depression. I've been on it for a year now and I don't know if it's worth taking it anymore. Maybe my irregular periods aren't meant to be like everyone else's. Maybe it'd be better if I just bled twice a month every month. Like I can't believe I have to be on antidepressants and BC for the rest of my life. That's so disappointing and frustrating. I can't believe I have to depend on some fucking pills to even be happy for a moment. Recently if things don't go according to plans, gives me major anxiety attacks or it just really really really makes me want to shut off. I'm just soooooooooooo fucking frustrated. I don't want to talk to anyone anymore. I wish I had no one in my life so I could easily go somewhere and die maybe. But I have so much to live for at the same time. I don't know who I am anymore.

I've had issues with my mental health for about four years, but have only been diagnosed for the past two. I don't like to talk about this with people because I'm just so afraid to lose the friends i have. I don't go into detail with anyone unless they ask questions, because I don't want to overshare or make them feel like they have to fix anything. I basically just said *""The reason \[redacted\] happened is because I'm dealing with depression, and I'm trying to deal with it as best as i can"".* I don't really know what I expected to happen. They took it surprisingly well, though, saying things along the lines of  *""I'm glad you told me""* and *""Let me know if you need anything"".* I don't feel like I deserve their kindness. I have never experienced this before (people wanting to help &amp; be there for me) and I don't feel like I deserve it.

I still feel completely alone, though. I hate how I am, because I want to be able to be the best friend I can be to these people. But right now I'm just drained and overwhelmed.

And keeping my room clean. And cooking. And spending time with my family. I remember a few days ago thinking, âI can finally feel it. I can finally see why people want to live.â?It welled up in my chest like flowers blooming. But Sunday was a bad day, someone said something about people wanting to die and I closed my eyes and all I could see was me, dying, over and over dying, graphic images I didn't want to see, more vivid than they've ever been. Always trauma to the head or neck, a dozen different ways, explosions and tears and slices and strangulation and so much. Just so much. Cycling. I couldn't open my eyes for a minute. I couldn't open my eyes and for a few seconds it felt good, and then something shifted and it hurt so bad. My throat hurt and my eyes burned and tears came that I did my best to hide. I was with people, I was with so many people, and I had to stay with them for hours. Images blurred inside my eyes. Every time I closed them the pictures were there. I died a thousand deaths and kept conversation flowing through my lips while I drowned in them. Even when I couldn't see anything anymore apart from my head being crushed, ripped from my shoulders, blown up from the inside out. I waded through the rest of the day with a scream in my throat, a half step away from a panic attack, smiling for an audience I didn't want to lie to. Sunday. They're still here. It's hard to tell whether they're with me or I'm with them. I can make them go away for a bit, if I'm going and going with loud music in my ears and fully encompassing tasks in my hands and eyes and feet. I've listened to a lot of ACDC. I've gone grocery shopping and made meals for the week and cleaned three rooms of my house. The second I take a break, I try to take a breath, my throat starts to close up and my eyes tingle and they crawl through my skull from my ears, forward and back and up and down and everywhere, they're everywhere. I have no space to run from them because they've found every corner of my mind and painted it. Can't stop moving.",0

323,"Agomelatine Sexual Side Effects : Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this, but I am a little lost trying to find information and would appreciate any help people can give. Hiya, so I have been diagnosed with OCD/anxiety, and I also suffer from mild-moderate depression. I have been discussing antidepressants with my GP, and I am considering asking for agomelatine/valdoxan. My main concerns with medication are: no sexual side effects, and no extensive tapering needed when stopping the medication. I have tried mirtazapine but found the zombie like foggy feelings too much to tolerate, and I am in the UK so Wellbutrin is not an option.  Agomelatine seems to fit my criteria, but I have come across a couple of anecdotes about sexual side effects developing after a longer period of time on this medication, and I wanted to ask if anyone could give me more information/any more anecdotes regarding sexual side effects of this drug. I know it is generally considered to have very few sexual side effects, especially compared to other antidepressants, but I want to understand if this means essentially no potential for such side effects, or just a very low incidence.Furthermore, I am aware that sexual dysfunction can persist after stopping medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs. Does anyone know if there is a similar risk with agomelatine? Sexual dysfunction is something I have struggled with in the past, and I am absolutely unwilling to risk potentially permanent side effects, so I want to be aware before discussing with my doctor since he is not overly informed about the exact side effects of particular psychiatric medications.

My luck really sucks, maybe the universe doesn't want me to get help either.Wonder how i'm gonna survive till then.I haven't talked with my parents cuz i can't seem to muster the courage eventhough they're loving &amp; supportive, guess cuz i don't have any reason to feel like this.

330,"I'm tired of hearing ""it gets better"" over and over and over. It doesn't. It gets worse. : I'm tired of hearing this sentiment from well-meaning, but naive people.  I get that they're trying to help, but the words fall flat in the face of actual experience.I've been grappling with MDD for most of my life.  Every damn day has been an uphill battle with no real payoff.  From the moment I wake up to the moment I hit the bed, my mind is filled with ""I want to die.  I wish to no longer exist.""I've tried meds.I've tried therapy, both one-on-one and group.I've tried experimental stuff like ECT and Ketamine infusions.I've tried exercise and eating better.I've spent time in psych wards.Not a single damn thing has changed the fact that I'd rather be dead than alive.  And as the years go by the feeling has only intensified.Maybe, for some people, it gets better.  Good for them.  But for a lot of people it doesn't.  I wish more people understood that one person's experience with depression isn't the same as everyone else's.",0
331,"Anyone else fucking hate being dependent on medication? : It works and as a result of it I'm able to function normally so I feel like I shouldn't complain, but still I hate the fact that I have to take it. It's not even that if I forget to take a dose I'll feel like shit all day.It's the feeling that now I'm completely at the mercy of the pharmaceutical industry and the next Martin Shkreli type of scumbag can decide to raise the price astronomically at any moment just because he feels like it. I feel like I have to be thankful to some piece of shit pharmaceutical company execs just for not deciding to bankrupt people like us.Also that if there is a significant disruption in the modern supply chain that all industrialized places rely on, tough shit! Time to go cold turkey! I know that depression isn't an actual illness that can kill you by itself so it's not the best comparison, but the reason so many people in Puerto Rico died from Hurricane Maria wasn't because of drowning or being crushed by rubble, it was because they ran out of their medication or power for the devices that kept them alive.I hate that I need meds to function. It makes me feel pathetic and dependent on a system that I hate with every fiber of my being. And I hate knowing that had I been born in literally any other era or even most places in the world today I'd be dead by now.Anyone else feel similarly?",0
332,"I've been on this earth for 18 years and I want out. : I've been through a lot and nothing really helps me anymore. My depression meds keep me from feeling sad, but they also make my shitshow of a life more apparent to me. My closest friends keep leaving me because I'm too much when I'm at my worst. I've been trying to get better but I keep relapsing. Bad things keep happening to me one after the other, and I can't take it anymore. I've weighed my options carefully and I think the best thing I can do for the few people that still care about me is to die. They shouldn't have to deal with my breakdowns or my suicidal moments. They shouldn't have to worry about me killing myself anymore. Once I'm dead, they can all move on with their lives without having to worry about me anymore. In my eyes, my death is me showing them mercy. I'll be doing them a favor.",0

My grades in high school are bad so my options are limited, plus I don't have any passions to follow. As for work, I'm the opposite of fit, and every job I can find that doesn't require secondary education or people skills (yay severe social anxiety) are labor jobs like construction.I feel like I'm just infinitely stuck, in a world where if you're not charismatic and happy you're fucked.I don't know what to do anymore and just want it all to end.

I have been in therapy, I have been on Prozac and have been meeting with a psychiatrist monthly. I just got promoted at my job after only being there for 6 months.None of that means anything to me if the person I love hates me and thinks I am pathetic. People at work think I've been screwing management to get my promotion. I have a target on my back and for no reason other than I'm trying to improve my life.I've made a fair share of mistakes. My SO is beyond done with me because I lied about smoking cigarettes. Before my mental health was under control, I'd smoke every now and again, knowing he didn't like it. I was selfish and only think about myself and what makes me feel better. He is right, I am pathetic.Nobody at my job respects me anymore. Nobody looks at me the same way since I was promoted. I wanted to be the department trainer because of my previous experience, my hardworking nature, and my care for people and their mental health in the workplace. Nobody will get my name out of their mouth. My SO works in the same building as me and my life is far beyond damaged by all of this.I am neck deep in debts that I will never be able to pay, due to my last relationship ending from abuse and me escaping with no money to my name.

340,"My entire life is falling apart due to the coronavirus. : I have diagnosed depression and am on the autism spectrum. As a result the little social interaction I do have is incredibly important and bordering on life saving to me: conferences, board game nights, public events, the few parties I am invited to. When they are present, I'm not happy exactly, but happier. When they are gone, I don't see much of a point in living.However, of course, much of that has either been canceled, or is the kind of thing people are saying don't do for public health reasons, and this seems likely to go on for months, if not longer. (I'm in one of the cities with a lot of cases, and the governor has banned large gatherings already.) So now I have nothing and no one.The thought of being forced to not leave the house is devastating. The thought of those social events not returning is even more devastating, let alone the long term repercussions to my future career (layoffs have started; conferences are the reasons it exists.) The thought of what happens if I do get sick is devastating both for the normal reasons and because I am never lonelier than when I am sick by myself, with no one to check on me or invested in my life. And I honestly don't think it is catastrophizing. If anything events are worse than I anticipated.Basically, it feels like I have been consigned to a joyless life for an indefinite period of time, with serious moral consequences if I go against it, and I don't know what to do. (I do not have a plan or anything, but I have more than once had the morbid thought that I can't commit suicide because a dead body is a public health risk.) I was already short on reasons to think the future will be brighter; now I cannot see any at all.",0

I've been on 20mg of prozac for almost two years now, and on and off it's given me super vivid dreams. It's been worse the past few weeks / months though.  I have super vivid dreams, some of which are really upsetting.  It's not just that I remember them super well, they're actually hard to forget.  It might be because my job is really dull and repetitive right now, I spend all day staring at a screen doing kind of mindless things, but I keep randomly remembering moments from dreams I had a week ago, or days ago, and feeling haunted.  And then each night I have new dreams that will haunt me for weeks.  It's weird.  I'm more venting than anything else - it seems like there's not really an answer.",0

I was clinically diagnosed with depression during my senior year of High School. My friend group has started to go its own ways no matter how hard I try to meet up with my friends it doesn't really seem like they meet me effort wise. Its always been difficult for me to make friends outside of the people I grew up with. I always have this self critical inside voice during social interactions with anyone im not comfortable with. Usually ultra analyzing my own behavior and trying to do the ""right"" things. Its awful and it really prevents me from making friends I feel like. So its been months and I have no friends, haven't had a girlfriend since graduation and im just lonely and sad all the time. Every now and then I think about suicide but I just dont have the guts to do it. I have this feeling that because of that Im not really depressed because If I was I would be able to kill myself.

None of my treatments have worked, SSRIs made me worse and SNRIs only fixed minor symptoms like mood. Therapy and CBT do not work. And I feel so alone because the more I try and reach out, or find information about what I'm going through online, the more I realise that I'm alone in this.I cannot get out of bed, and barely eat. I have not lost motivation or ambition, but it's like I'm physically trapped in my body. My attention span and memory are terrible, I can barely remember what I did yesterday. I feel anxiety constantly, even when I'm doing nothing or trying to relax. I can't keep a routine or care for myself because I feel I cannot physically move anymore. I get hypersomnia and at worst I can sleep for up to 24 hours, but my average is usually about 12. My mind races and the only time I ever feel normal is when I manage to distract myself and literally forget about reality. And I get this really weird feeling that never disappears, it feels like a physical pain that's numb. Like, imagine your arm is numb and then you pinch it really hard. You can tell that your arm is having a sensation of pain, but without the actual pain being felt. It's like that for me everyday. I am just trapped in this bed slowly starving.The only conditions I have ever managed to find that might explain this are catatonic depression and/or psychomotor retardation. But it is so hard for me to find information online about these, and my doctors and therapist do not discuss it with me much. I know I should really fight for them to discuss it with me but I'm so anxious when I get there that I let them walk over me.Please, is there anyone out there who feels the same symptoms as I do?

(Important for later.)School closedâonline classes only thru the rest of the semesterâdue to Coronavirus. As of today. (Plan as of yesterday was to come back Apr. 6. Then, shortly after that letter from the University President, the POTUS announced his travel ban and the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the plan to return was cancelledâcommencement might still happen, but the semester is gonna be all online.)This has hit the performing artsâtheatre, dance, musicâdepartment(s) disproportionally hard. My head is spinning still. I'm nauseousâstill. The dorms were going to remain open (I was going to come back by Apr. 6 for sure), but now, everyone has to return from Spring Break, effectively rushing the campus (which is also horrible for disease control) and clean out our lives. We have until March 23 to get out of the dorms. I'm tearing down my life and packing it into boxes tomorrow.And... This year, I had finally overcome a huge trauma I dealt with years ago, where I had a falling out with some folks I was very close with for a long time. The last time I saw them, I had no idea it would be the last time. That trauma's at the root of so many things I struggle with. Then, today, as I read that letter and started shaking, crying, screaming... I'm a junior, and that whole swath of seniorsâI may never get to see them again. Friends, crushes, what have you... People I loved (loveâfuck, it's happening already), so, so much.âNo, no, no,â?I said. âI can't do it again, I can't do this again.â?I'll probably be working/writing thru this for a long time. A lot of other studentsâthe seniors, and performing arts seniors, especially; those affected by COVID-19 personally; and those for whom it'll be very hard to get homeâare being hit harder than I am. But I finally found my theatre family this year. This semester started with a serious, serious injury for me, but this week has still been the craziest (sorry, I hate that word, but I can't think of a better one right now) week of the semester.

354,"I can feel happiness? : I (22F) have spent the last 8 years of my life with intense depression. I never thought I had real depression though, just a series of bad days (the series lasted YEARS and I still didn't think it was REAL depression???). Eventually I tried to end it. It didn't work, so I tried harder 2 weeks later. I landed in the ICU for 3 days and a psych ward for a week. I was pissed. They made me start on meds and go to therapy 8 hours every day. When I got out, I spent the next 3 weeks with my family, so I couldn't try anything because everyone was watching me like a hawk. But over that month of being on meds, I gradually wanted to die less and less. I was still pretty unhappy, but not suicidal. I got up the courage, thanks to my husband, to go to a doctor and ask if there was anything else I could do to feel happy instead of just not suicidal. She prescribed two other meds, so now I take 3. They worked.Now, I'm not just not suicidal, I'm consistently happy. It's something I haven't felt in 8 years. Every time I feel that joy a tear or 3 roll down my cheek because I spent the last 8 years miserable, when $20/mo of prescriptions would have changed that. I'm crying now typing this out. Now, when I face challenges, I want to figure out a way to overcome them instead of figuring out the most painless/clean way to die. I can genuinely smile again?? I want to keep the commitments I made to my friends? It's honestly kind of bewildering. I'm a little scared of happiness after these years, but it feels so good. The people around me seem more friendly because I'M more friendly. I thought it was just a bad day all this time when it was literally a chemical problem. It wasn't my fault, it wasn't some kind of moral failure. The meds worked, they fixed the chemical problem. I don't have a message here, except maybe try meds &amp; therapy if you're hesitant? I'm not trying to be preachy, I'm just overwhelmed. Please hang in there guys. You are worth it. You deserve it.",0
355,"suicide note. : To Whom It May Concern,     If your eyes had the horrible misfortune of grazing this letter, just know I send my sincerest apologies and condolences to whoever actually deemed me as something to be worried about. It was very apparent that I was struggling with carrying myself anymore. I couldn't manage to continue dragging myself from day to day knowing how much I just wanted to stop and end it all. I feel as though I had given life a good attempt, and from my perspective, I feel like I gave all the effort I could possibly have given the circumstances and challenges I was placed in. I know an abundance of you either won't care or just be plain out disappointed in me. Truth be told, we all know this ending was eventually going to happen, but as humans, we all have a horrible habit of hoping when hope for the situation has run out. Either way, I know that for many of you the problems I faced were nothing compared to what many of you had to go through in your personal life, but I'm sorry for not being able to handle it. Although many of you will never admit it aloud, I know many of you will be relieved to not have to deal with this burden anymore. Truly though, I am a burden. I know many of you will deny this, but we all know this for a given fact. Someone wise once told me âJust because you don't believe it and I don't believe it, doesn't mean it isn't true.â?And I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that it is true. I know I was never the greatest friend, I know I was just âtoo depressedâ?to be worthy of being good enough of a friend of knowing what was going on in friendsâ?lives. I was selfish my whole life. I never let anybody open up to me due to the fact that I opened up too much and let everyone see too much of me. I let people see the raw parts of me. Even in my last months of life, I never noticed that people created such a facade around me. No one was ever truly genuine with me, and I was so afraid of people treating me differently when I opened up about being depressed and suicidal and lonely, but  I didn't know most of you already created a wall of bubble wrap for me before I told you all about the severity of it. You seemingly didn't cushion me because you had been all along. I'm sorry though, that I opened up too soon and too fast and it tainted the genuinity I believed we had. I'm sorry many of you had to hide your own emotions due to the fact that I was considered unfit to hear other problems or worries or concerns. I'm sorry I was so broken that everyone felt the need to not push me past my invisible limit anymore. At the end of the day, I'm sorry to so many of you for not being there when you needed someone just as much as I did. Back to being a burden, I deeply apologize to the number of friends and family members I had given all my problems to, and I want you to know I have the utmost and sincere sympathy for anyone who will see my death as a final burden. It's okay to be honest with yourself now though. I understand in full that I was a burden, and to whoever gains the worst opportunity in the world to read this, if you are shaking your head at the fact that I will always believe I am a burden, don't doubt this truth because if I weren't a burden to the world, then why was I treated like one. You don't treat a concern like a burden. Like as if you wish you could just dump it in the ocean, or cut it off from your life, or hang it in your room. Burdens you deal with because you must, not because you want to. Many of you dealt with me not because you wanted to, but for your own personal sake, which is understandable. I just want you, whoever treated me like a burden, whoever dubbed me as a burden, whoever saw me as a burden, to know that you should have stopped being selfish and let me go. I suffered because I thought I mattered to you all. I suffered because you all gave me hope. If we ever meet again in another life, in the same situation, please let me go. More importantly though, I am not necessary or wanted. I know many people were sick of me in my last moments of life. It was very apparent to me. I know that in life and in the long run, no one is truly necessary and that life moves forward, whether or not I choose to be present for it. I, however, obviously chose to no longer be present for the continuous psychological pain I would have suffered. The âwantâ?I wish people had for me was nothing close to present though. I could feel people growing bored with me, knowing and learning that I was someone who could be replaced. Nothing extraordinary. Nothing necessary. Nothing wanted. Don't get me wrong, when I made it known how I felt, so many people had given me the time of day and made me feel wanted. However, the amount of significance I felt on the daily basis was little to none. It pains me in so many ways to know that I wasn't important or necessary enough to anyone when it was a constant thing. I'm sorry I couldn't bare to manage the pain I suffered. The amount of pain that has grown over the years has become overwhelming and has seemingly overcome me. I do not know who I am anymore, the wave of depression never seemed to cease and with it came the rough waves that seemed to wipe away me. I couldn't continue. The loneliness was overwhelming. The surge of suicidal thoughts, the endless nights full of endless tears, the overbearing pressure that brings my heart down to the center of the earth, the unwillingness to continue anymore, and most of all the hopeless thoughts intruding my head when I attempt to reach for help. No matter how desperately I wanted to be helped, I couldn't find it in me to make the call or send the text or talk about the pain. No matter how much I felt like I was suffocating and that the breath of fresh air my body and soul needed was a simple form of cellular contact which would take no more than a second, it felt like the glimmer of hope and the final reassuring breath I need to gain my composure is light years away. I give you my deepest apologies about not being able to be a fully functioning and happy human being. I'm truly and most sincerely sorry from every section of my heart that I couldn't hold on and that I couldn't wait a second for a glimmer of hope, or a chance to find the way out of my endless tunnel. I hope you realize though, that you did not lose me. You did not lose me. You lost someone who looked like me, but was not mein the end. It's not me. I lost myself a long time ago. My true self has been swept away by my sadness. It was quite unfortunate, but I hope it doesn't hurt you too much by now knowing that you didn't lose me when I died. I was already gone. Thank you. If you ever wasted your precious time on me, just know that I am eternally grateful for you seeing something hopeful in me. I'm sorry to have let you down though. Maybe in another life I could be successful. I love you (all). Goodbye.",0
356,"I don't go to appointments, therapy, etc. and I don't know why. : WTF IS WRONG WITH ME? I'm the most anxious and stupid idiot out there. Or maybe I'm just lazy? Or both? I skip appointments so often. I used to skip 1 day of school every week. I got in a teen therapy group session which lasts for 8 weeks 8 am till 4 pm and guess what? I went on Monday after almost not going, then I skipped Tuesday till Friday (today). My anxiety won once again. They called my mom and told her that I have to come today or else they might call another teen to replace me on Monday. There is no way that I can come now. My anxiety is level 100 and I haven't slept at all today and yesterday. I fucking hate myself. I had this awesome opportunity to better myself and I fucking blew it. My therapist hates me now. The kids there probably hate me now as well, even though they didn't like me in the first place. The nurses there hate me now too (it's inside a Hospital). I hate this so much. Medication doesn't help and it seems like my psychatrist doesn't care at all. I want to rewind time. Or at least give me a second chance on Monday...  but I feel so bad that there's someone else waiting who needs it more than me. I don't deserve anything even remotely good in this life.

This has obviously sucked for both of us, our sex life is nonexistent recently. Luckily we're very open when it comes to things like this, so it didn't cause any tension or frustration.

372,"First post. : I've been sitting for over an hour in the dark listening to music while trying to think of what to say. I guess that I just wanted to tell my story in segments on the forums from time to time and get things off my mind.I'll start off by saying that I suffer from severe depression, among other things. I'm 32 years old and have tried to take my own life on a couple occasions. I'm not depressed at the moment.I guess I'll start with saying my parents didn't have children to start a family like most couples. My father knocked up my mother when they were graduating. They had a shotgun wedding shortly before my older brother was born. My father had come from the country side with 8 siblings in total and planned to live in the country when he could buy a place. His mind set was that he wanted kids for free labor to help around the ranch. My dad drank, smoked, had a temper and would cheat on my mother. When I was younger I caught my father with another woman. She didn't even know that he had kids and I had stumbled upon them. He tried to hide it and introduced me as his son. They knew that they were caught and she ended up leaving. I had to be the one to tell my mother. But this apparently wasn't the first time that he cheated. It drove my mother a bit crazy and she questioned her self as being a good house wife and she would repeatedly ask me if she was a good house wife. My father is really manipulative and controlling. He also had a short temper and as my mother would call it, he would go red brained cause all he would see was red.I was bullied as a young kid and moved around a lot. I changed schools five times so it was hard to make and keep friends. I came from the country so I didn't really get to hang out with other kids. That and I came from somewhat of a broken home. My dad wasn't allowed to chaperon field trips after a incident during a trip that involved him. I also was outcast by other kids for a bit by his actions. I also couldn't have other kids around my house as my father would do things around any friends that I brought over.  I made a couple friends at one school but they ended up moving away. I always kept to my self, just eating alone etc.I don't celebrate my birthdays or Christmas. When I was growing up my birthdays were all pretty bad or we just didn't have them so I had just stopped trying to celebrate them. I don't even think we celebrated over half my birthdays due to my parents just not celebrating them. I remember one time I saved up money and wanted to go out for sushi. My mother said they couldn't afford it and I told her that I could pay for it, they could just drive me. They ended up leaving in the morning and left me at the house cause they said that they had to go do something (I can't remember). They were gone the whole day. I ended up making a package of noodles for supper on my birthday cause at the time that was all I could make. They came back at night time before I headed to bed. My parents ended up going out for supper and lunch. My dad also brought in a few hundred dollars of tools that he didn't need but bought any ways. They made a dentist appointment on another birthday and I needed to be put under with gas and that made me throw up all day after wards. They didn't plan anything for that birthday any ways so not like it mattered. Another birthday my parents told me that my father had to work and that they would have it on his days off but never did. Those were the good birthdays. When I was a teenager I knew I had to get away from my parents and so I worked for farmers when ever I could get away from working for my dad. My dad found out that I was working for another farmer on my time off and didn't like that one bit, he called up the farmer yelling at him told him not to hire me for any more jobs. Any ways I would do odd jobs or work as a ranch hand, rock picking fields or doing what ever I could in order to earn money. I saved up enough money and when I was sixteen I dropped out of school and moved out. I moved in with my older brother.The day I turned 18 I started work at the local mine. After some time the bullying started up again. Workers would make up stories about me and would back stab in order to move up. I was blamed for things that I didn't do and people at the mines would vandalize the mines property. It was like school all over again. The someone spray painted my name with insults down in the tunnels. They would write stuff in the washroom stalls. Even new workers that I never met on other shifts would make stories up about me. Rumors spread around and I was constantly being called into the office. The supervisor knew the stories weren't true and talked with me about it. He knew I was being bullied and people were just trying to move up. In the spring the bullying got way worse and I tried to take my life. I failed and ended up in the psych ward. I quit my job and moved to a different town. I became more quiet and withdrew into a shell. Distancing my self from people.That summer I met a woman like no other. She was working as a waitress. I was shy and would sit by myself. She would talk with me and treated me different then other people had treated me. I tried to work up the courage to ask her out. I even wrote my number on a napkin to give to her. But before I could give it to her she said ""I don't normally do this but if I give you my number would you call me"". I didn't hesitate to say yes. We started dating. I'm was gentleman, I held doors open for her, open the vehicle doors and helped her into them, walked on the outside of the sidewalks near the road, didn't swear, always paid for everything. She once surprised me, she said she wanted to treat me to a carnival ride, no one had ever done that for me before. When we were alone nothing else mattered. Time flew by yet we didn't seem to notice. In the fall I purposed to her, she said yes. I was so happy back then. She even convinced me to celebrate my birthdays. One day she sat me down and told me that she was pregnant. We were happy, I was happy. I would now know what it's like and get to experience what I was like to have a real family...She was kind. Always looking out for me. She even talked me into going back and finishing school. So I did. I went through a store front school and graduated in two week. She always pushed my to be better and I wanted to be for her.However happiness doesn't last forever. We went for a check up and the doctor discovered that she had cancer. They told her that she couldn't have the baby. They gave her two months to live. I couldn't speak. Every time I tried to opened my mouth I would start crying. Looking back at it now, I don't think I ever seen her cry. She would just look at me and smile. The only thing that I think she was most sad about was that the baby didn't get to experience this world. Once again I was going to be alone. I couldn't bare it and I tried to OD on a couple bottles of pills. Once again I failed to take my life. She was there and told me ""It's not your time"".  She lived past the two month that the doctors gave her and past away in the summer. (Even now it's difficult for me to just type this as my eyes water up and my throat feels like it is closing up).I just wanted to die. I stopped eating, All I could do is lay in bed for a year.  I hate my life. Good guys don't win or maybe it's just that I'm not a good guy. Idk.",0
373,"I don't know what to do. : I posted this in another community and I thought I'd put it here too, why not.I've  never posted something like this, but for once I've no one, nowhere and  not even the will to reach out in my personal life anymore. I have  nowhere else to turn.I had a  psychiatry appointment today, one I've been waiting for for uite a  while, you could say I've been waiting nearly a year since being told  I'd be put straight into another mental health service and wouldn't be  left alone out in the deep end. You can probably guess where this  story's going.The psychiatrist  heading the community service that I was in until this morning decided  to discharge me, against my wishes. She didn't allow me to speak in the  appointment. When I could get a few words in she would cut me off. She  wrote off some points that I wanted to bring up as simple personality  traits and that I can't compare myself to others, that each person is  different. Well if it were that simple I wouldn't be in the services.  She said that I shouldn't strive to label myself or something when I  brought up that I suspect I've autism. No matter how many times I said  how it's getting more and more difficult to exist in day to day life  with others I wasn't listened to.She  told me what I thought, or what I went through. I said my last  psychiatrist dismissed a lot my issues. She said that he didn't, even  though these are two completely different services. This doctor in  particular stated that I don't have depression and the source of most of  my issues is me over exaggerating things in my head. Never got to say  that because she wasn't interested in listening to me.From  the beginning she had an opinion of me that I felt like I was going to  have to fight against, and she never let go of it, leading her to  finally discharge me. She said that I don't appear to like the service,  that it's not beneficial, that I'm not happy with it and that I always  had something to say about it. From the beginning of my attendance to  this service I was never entirely sure of how I was being deal with. I  had a main appointment at the beginning where she had to get to know me  and my history. I was at the end of my rope at that point in my life due  to trying to finish school and being in an abusive relationship where I  was gaslit into thinking I was an awful broken person. I had very few,  maybe 2 max I think, ""check in"" appointments later where 2 different  doctors did just that, check in on me and asking basic uestions to write  down the answers to in my file. At these points in my life I was  cripplingly depressed, had no idea what was going on at all due to, yk,  trauma. My head was beyond broken and I couldn't articulate much other  than ""I feel terrible"" in those appointments. Today she backtracked on  those check-ins, that they were proper meetings, that I didn't like the  service sure I can't even make sense of what she said now as I'm writing  this. I had no appointment during the next period of my life where I  genuinely just wanted to do away with myself which is a sentiment that  has yet to leave me and has been massively exasperated from today.  One  of the doctor's even said in the meetings I've had before that there was  nothing he could really help me with because he didn't know me, that it  was a bit pointless to be doing mindfulness exercises, that he didn't  believe in half that shit. The other doctor ended up hugging me at the  end of our meeting because I was so fucking depressing. And today there  was this bitch again.Apologies if the above paragraph isn't all that clear, I'm truly confused as to what my situation is too.She  told me that I have no mental illnesses and cut me off whenever I tried  to say that I had no official diagnosis', just recommendations and  screenings because I never got the time of day anywhere. The only chance  that I had originally was the last psychiatrist that demeaned me. She  replied to me in these exact words: ""We're doctors, not imbeciles. These  doctors haven't found anything in you before. They would've seen  something if there was."" I had two check in appointments and that was  it. She also said that I've already been diagnosed with aspergers. I  haven't been, the child health service said it was a likely possibility  and wrote a recommendation about it in my file. I was seen very little  times because I was over 18 when they finally saw me. They told me  explicitly that this wasn't an official diagnosis. If it was, my  previous service would have known. She refused to listen and rejected  that.I  began tearing up at some point, leading to full blown sobbing in the  end, to which her only response was (at the door to the office) \[name\]  come on, I have to move on to the next person.I  broke down crying on the floor of the toilet inside. I couldn't go out  in public in that condition. This is possibly the lowest I've felt since  I: 1: Was left on the floor of my abusive ex boyfriend's floor to curl  into a fetal position and cry, and 2: Crying in the school bathroom and  cutting my arm after being demeaned by my principal for the sin of  reaching out for help.This seuence of events has happened far too often for me to not give up finally, relapse into stuff or you know.",0

It's more of a perfectionist type OCD where I need to do things perfectly and plan things in advance which makes my hobbies tedious and tiring.I also have Aspergers so I just come across as socially awkward and I only have one friend which I met online which lives in Canada so I only ever talk to her through the Internet and due to the time differences, it's difficult to.

I got discharged from the military nearly 8 years ago with PTSD and spent the last 6-7 years living with family but not really being able to maintain any kind of relationships. I recently got my own place and for the past few months been feeling lonelier and lonelier. I feel so sick to my stomach when I think about how socially awkward I am even at my current job.

I tried different apps to meet friends/people around my area but either I end up deleting the app because I get no responses or I literally chicken out from showing up.

Even with that aside, my relationship with them has always been complicated. After my lowest pointâthe day I realized that if I killed myself, it would take days before anyone even noticedâit took about a year for me to just reach functional, and another one to feel somewhat normal.

382,"Dealing with depression and GAD when alone : Like many people at the moment, I'm spending a lot of time alone and keeping my distance from my friends and family. It's the advice for those of us who have a flu-like symptom. I have a slight cough, which might well be bought on by medication, but it's enough for me to be responsible and self-isolate. Anyway, I've recently been diagnosed with depression and GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) and I'm starting my sessions in CBT, and it was going well and I'm starting to learn that I've been living with this 'hum' of depression and GAD for a couple of years, and it's been a trigger for negative reactions and dark days. I'd started to make progress with the therapist in understanding where these voices come from, but this is very early in my journey. Today has been hard. I'm at home, alone and reading the news about CORVID, looking at data and the 'what ifs' start in my head again and the scenarios I imagine are darker each time. To the point where, knowing that I'm not showing any of the symptoms, hugging my eldest kid makes me tear myself apart with guilt. What I need at the moment are tool and mechanisms to deal with this. How do you   A) keep those noises from your head  B) Stop them when they startI have a call with my GP on Tuesday about issues that are linked with this, as I think I'm actually now at the point where I need medication, as a total breakdown is now a daily occurrence when it used to be an annual thing. So, hopefully, more long-term and sustainable help is on the way, but I've still got 4 days to get through before that call, so any advice is welcome!",0
383,"âWhy don't you try to changeâ?: I'm super frustrated. I just need to vent, so please bear with me.I basically explained to my roommate that I know that I am generally hated/disliked, to which she asked me why I say that. I also said, I know this is the way it is, and I can't change myself. I've tried and it only hurts me. People won't like me that way, I am well aware from trial and error.I can read other people very well. This is part of where my anxiety comes from. I very well know that people don't like me. They don't have to be outright mean to be rude, you know? It always hurts, no matter how long I've dealt with it. I have experienced this discomfort with the way people view me my entire life. I know that people don't like me, it's simply a matter of fact. I have genetic anger issues. I cannot stop myself from becoming infuriated, and I even take medication for it. Still, sometimes my frustration leaks through. This often caused me trouble in my youth, as I was very easy to tease. I cry when I'm angry. I stutter, too. I think forever about what I could have said or done in that moment. I lived in a conservative community, and I became very liberal in my later years. I made really incredible friends by pure luck, and while they are few, they are everything to me. Still, it's like a bandaid on a broken bone.I'm too uncomfortable to use social media because I can't gain a following or deal with the fact that I'm displaying myself to be viewed and judged by others. I only use reddit and snapchatthese days. I've had depression for about five years. I'm medicated and I distract myself from most of my issues in not very proactive ways, but it gets the job done. Nowadays, I don't dwell on it too much, but it always comes crawling back. Especially since I've finally come out as trans, and I'm dealing with (by no means terrible) backlash from my family and others around me. I'm constantly questioning myself, and sometimes when I dwell on it for too long, I become paralyzed with fear and misplaced regret. I wish I was quieter. I wish I wouldn't talk about my feelings so much. I wish I opened my mouth less, and kept my opinions to myself. But I can't stand the audacity of others, who run their mouths in ignorance. It's literally infuriating, and I snap back. I cannot help myself. Truly, I cannot help myself. I can't help myself be more liked. I can't stop myself from being who I am. I'm exhausted of being looked down upon for my methods and ideas. When I was fourteen, I worked in this place with a bunch of peers who didn't like me at all. There was a big mirror that I'd pass constantly, and everytime I passed it, I would think, âthere's something wrong with me.â?I used to want to disappear so badly. I would cry almost every day. Now I'm grown and in a much better place, but from time to time, that thought crosses my mind. I am inherently different. There is a glitch in my system. I am fucked up. Not because I'm queer or anything. I'm just messed up. I wish so badly that I could help myself, but I don't know how. How do I manage this general dislike I have congregated for myself? Not just from myself, but from others as well. I don't hate myself, but I certainly don't like myself, either. I want to be better, not just in the realm of my mental state, but towards others. I want to be the person I've always aspired to be. That's not someone who is super cool or well liked, just someone who speaks knowledgably and lives beyond this world. I don't want to be so engrossed in this anymore.",0

385,"I drink to sleep better : I'm a highschooler and I've had insomnia for about 5 years now. Ik that alcohol is proven to worsen sleep but for me, instead of waking up every 3-4 hrs or not falling asleep till 3 hours after I get into my bed, a few shots before I get into bed helps me just breathe better and wake up less. This has been my schedule for a several months. I still wake up in the night but it's less often and when I wakeup I dont feel so angry at myself and i feel kinda light headed ina good way so i fall back asleep faster. My sleep is better but ik sooner or later my bodys gonna show the effects of  the alcohol soon. I already developed  stomach gastritis  last year and ik the alcohol  wont help it at all.

386,"Impending cycle of doom : I need help. I recently got out of an inpatient facility which was great, and now I'm back out in the world. Well, not really. I'm doing an outpatient program which is helpful and all but I always want to cut myself. I don't want to die but the urge to cut is overwhelming. A plus, I think all my friends hate me. Before I was inpatient I was going through a really rough time with a few people at school and they really abandoned me when I needed them most. I mean they just really shit on me when I already wanted to kill myself. I told my friend that I wanted to kill myself and was pretty convinced that I was going to and he shrugged it off. Didn't tell anyone or express concern which was disappointing but I guess you can't ask people to always do that right thing. Luckily I broke down and therapy and ended up in the ER before I could overdose on ativan, trazedone, and vodka. I'm out now and doing better but my friends are being shit and I'm really craving to cut. It's fucked up but the feeling of cutting is indescribable and impossible to duplicate. I guess I don't want to but I don't know how to stop myself.",0

388,"i was recently diagnosed with depression : Hello, as my titled says, I was recently diagnosed with depression. I don't know where else to tell my story but I feel like I need to do it to prevent myself from doing something bad. I'm 18, I live in France and i've started going to college in September. Since then, I was feeling really off, as if I was some kind of second character in other people's lives, but also in my own. I was feeling really lonely, but seeing my other friends feeling the same way reassured me in this feeling. However, as the time went by, I saw those same people gradually becoming better while I wasn't, and I started losing contact with them. I used to be really friendly, always laughing and going out, while being really dedicated to my studies. Since then, it's just as if everything just started becoming black. I've lost interest in going out, making jokes and laughing didn't light the same sparkle in me, studying made me feel dumb and empty. I constantly feel like i've chosen the wrong path, but feel like i'm not good enough for another one, and i always wanted to come back to my parents but i wasn't feeling right in my place anywhere. It started to became more and more frequent, with thoughts of quitting everything, or that I didn't belong anywhere, etc. I didn't want to go out anymore, or when I did, I just needed to drink to feel in a right headspace, or else I just felt as if I was standing aside of my own body, not knowing how to act or what to say to make believe that I was doing okay when really I wasn't. I started to see my college's psychologist but he really didn't help me and instead made me feel really weird about myself and the way I felt. I spoke about it to my mother, which wasn't that concerned because I hadn't told her yet that I was thinking a lot about death and suicide. She helped me find a psychologist, which I started to see every week, since february. She immediately told me that she thought I had depression and needed to take medicine, and so I had to go see a psychiatrist to get them. With my psychologist, we talk a lot about my life in the past and how I could see the world as another point of view, and she makes me think of a lot of things about me, but really she just points out a lot of things that i do or am that kind of make me sad about myself. What really scared me is that I usually enjoyed a lot going to concerts, which made me really happy and the last two i went to made me feel so much anxiety and discomfort that I had to go out before the end. I was really disappointed towards myself. By then, I tried going to several places to find a psychiatrist but no one helped me or took me seriously and I felt like I would never be helped, and I felt like I didn't really want to on the inside. I wrote a suicide note, and I was ready to try to kill me. My boyfriend saw it and he prevented my mother, which came by me crying saying she didn't know I had the intention to do it. We went to a hospital to seek medical help but there were a lot of kids who were really sick and I didn't feel at the right place at all. We finally found a psychiatrist, which diagnosed me with depression, and anxiety. She gave me meds that I have to take daily and are supposed to make me feel happy again. I hate it because everytime I want to swallow the entire pack, whether it is to die or get better quicker. I started questioning myself if I had always been depressed. I've always felt as if I wasn't part of this world in some way, or that I didn't deserve to be here.Now, i'm not better at all but I like writing down my feelings. I'm living normally and i'm trying to do stuff to keep me occupied but i'm always bored because I always want to do something but I never know what; I'm vainly angry at people that love me because they love me; when i cross a crosswalk I always think of a car hitting me and then of me suffering; I always want to sleep to forget that im alive; When I laugh I feel like I shouldn't be doing it; I feel like i'm not really depressed because my problems aren't important; I feel like i'm useless and that I'll never be important to anyone; I feel like my life is pointless and that it'll never change; I feel like I should always excuse myself because I'm not a good person; I feel like the ugliest person in the world; and sometimes I just burst into tears because it is just too much and the weight is too heavy and I want to take it off. That's my story dealing with depression. Everyday I wake up knowing that one day I'll take my life away, but I want to get better; because people get hurt because of me. I'm hurting them because I deeply hate myself and I'm constantly fighting against myself. I hope i'll get better.",0
389,"I'm (19f) trying not to bring down my friend's (22m) mood : I go through these weird cycles of being in a really great mood and feeling positive &amp; courageous &amp; like I can do anything, but then plummeting into a really dark depressive state for twice as long. And that's kind of where I feel myself going right now. I'm exhausted and overwhelmed but also overwhelmed, and I'm starting to feel the joy flicker out. My last day off from both jobs was Feb. 20th &amp; my next day off isn't until March 19th, and even though I only have a week left until I get there, it's one day and then I'm back to at least 1-2 weeks with no day off. I'm feeling burned out from work, and between never having a lot of time or every, and my insecurities I've been struggling to eat. I've struggled with an eating disorder for a long time on my own and sometimes when I get depressed I forget to eat and then when I do get hungry I feel guilty. Stupid, I know, but it is what it is. Okay so now that you have some backstory/context of what I'm feeling, here's my current problem; I've sparked up a friendship with this guy recently (met through reddit, he's British &amp; I'm American) and as silly as it sounds I just connected with him so well. We've been talking every day for a few weeks and we send each other snapchats &amp; voice memos all the time. We've both already admitted to having a crush on each other but we're still just friends &amp; we do a lot of encouraging each other as he seems to deal with similar emotions &amp; doesn't get a lot of sleep. We both always dread work and feel exhausted by our day but today for me was just draining on such an intense level that didn't really hit me until I got home. I want to talk about it with him since I don't feel like I have anyone else to talk to but he told me about how good his day way &amp; how positive he's feeling and I really really don't want to ruin that for him. It makes me really happy that his day was so good &amp; he deserves to sit in that positivity. I don't want him to have to comfort me or feel bad for me, but it's just hard not telling anyone. So here I am, using reddit as a way to get it out of my system. I try so hard to find ways to feel good and stay hopeful when I feel myself getting into that's his negative state of mind but it's just so hard when the work I put into it comes up with very small results. I just wish I could sink into the floor for a month or so then come back up when things start feeling more lighthearted.",0
390,"I really don't see any reason to continue living... : I recently found out that because of the medication I've been taking for the past 10 years, I'm at high risk of PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction), loss of emotions, Anhedonia, impaired cognitive thinking, lack of empathy, etc. Tbe risks are LONG-TERM, EVEN LIFELONG for some people. I take the highest dose for these 10 years as well, making me even more at risk.I already experience extents of all of these things sometimes, so I highly expect to be affected if, or more likely when (due to most likely inevitable loss of health insurance) I discontinue my meds, a slow taper is said to NOT prevent the risks.I'm 24, live with my parents, failed my driving test (never been very comfortable with driving, but not driving has been life crippling), been extremely socially isolated for years, have no friends (not even online anymore, it just felt pointless continuing to talk to people I'd never see in real life), never had a girlfriend and I'm a goddamn virgin who's never even kissed.A girl on Whisper just roasted me for implying we should hookup before we die from the CoronaVirus, I didn't have the balls to follow through anyway, I can't leave the house with being questioned, even if my parents aren't home, the cameras send notifications to all of our phones. Explaining this kind of thing would be VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.I told the girl I was not a player, and it was important to me that she enjoyed it. She told me I was worse than the perverts who message her, because I didn't even offer to buy her dinner.She ten accused me of being unable to get pussy and living in my mom's basement, which (apart from the basement part, to be technical) is pretty spot on.I then opened up with honesty about my depression and told her I'm sorry and I'll leave her alone. She didn't respond again.Yes, I'm 24 and still at home, and securing a basic job bagging groceries like a teenager's first job has been a huge accomplishment for me. And I just started community college spring 2020. Being 24, my financial aid is plentiful and safe, because it requires MY OWN financial information and NOT MY PATIENTS (one of my classmates recently got dropped out due to losing financial aid, good Ol America).Socially, the only way it's better than grade school is I'm not bullied. But nobody really talks to me either, and I feel more cut off from humanity than exes, despite being surrounded by people everyday (school and work).Due to my living situation (can't drive, live with parents, have such a bottom level job) I'm way too insecure to even try and make friends, I know people will judge me. Asking out women? Forget about that completely.I am not, never have been, and never will be, an extrovert.I already know I'm widely considered unattractive, but I don't think that is the true biggest barrier, I think it is to do with my social skills and insecurity. I'm being expected to be more and more independent and responsible at my age, and in less than a couple of years, legally kicked off of my parents health insurance, and it's highly unlikely the job I have now will provide that even by then.... And to know that the chemicals/neurotransmitters in my brain have been, and/or will be altered so greatly that I will be incapable of basic human feelings and functionings, not even being a human being anymore, is the most terrifying thing I've ever faced in my life. There is no cure, or treatment? for PSSD and the other Post SSRI long-term/life-long side effects.Doctors do not take PSSD/long-term/permanent SSRI side effects seriously, and even if they did, they would be unable to do anything about it.My doctor has been to trigger happy in raising dosages just for me having any amount of depression, anxiety, anger, etc. left. I was put on Oxcarbazepine 600 MG twice a day and Sertraline 200 MG a day 10 years ago for life crippling OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). And more recently, Bupropion SR 100 MG a day to get my rage outbursts under control, as I was becoming a danger to myself and others, and at serious risk of ending up getting arrested with how explosive my rage was.My doctor asked me if I still had any depression, anger, anxiety, etc. A couple of months later, and immediately upon saying yes, doubled my Bupropion SR to 200 MG a day. About a week later, he told me I could cut back to 100 MG, as I was suffering from worsened anxiety, and worse sexual dysfunction (which I didn't mention).I only care about my sexual functioning because I was holding hope, that id get to use it, one day, hopefully while still in my 20s.....Ironically, I wished away my sexuality and even my emotions just days before the doubled dose seemed to grant my wish, causing me serious regret.I seem to have returned to baseline of before the Bupropion SR was doubled, but my ejaculate volume is still much lower (before I cummed A LOT).After the effects of double Bupropion SR I found out about PSSD from Googling my symptoms, and I fell down the rabbit hole. I've been worried about this 24/7 ever since. So about a month now....I'm still worried about the inevitable likely forced cutoff of my medication, permanently (or even if it's just for a few years, still serious) disabling me (it can even go beyond sexual functioning) and being uninsured will only hurt even more as a vegetable. I also have to worry about becoming severely disabled from OCD returning full-blown.If I want to pay so I can lose my virginity, even that has a time limit if losing my meds means losing my libido, and/or at the least even less pleasurable orgasms...This SSRI BULLSHIT just reinforces my feelings of being sexually worthless, and just not being a human being.",0
391,"Looking for an advise to overcome my lifetime depression. Meditation? Morning routines? Thank you all in advance. : Hello there..Ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety (I know, the basics right?) since I was 16 yo. Although I've had many other diagnosis through all this time (ADD, OCPD, Bipolar Disorder, Etc, etc etc) , any way I couldn't care less for a diagnosis right now. I am now 28 yo and I've been around 20 different psychologists, around 8 psychiatrists, many analysis, and several different meds (clonazepan, methylphenidate, fluvoxamine, VPA, fluoxetine, bromazepam, alprazolam, blah, blah blah..) And I've been interned 2 times into hospitals because of my panic attacks. Is good to say that i have never been addicted to anything but my negative thoughts, and I am only taking bromazepam (because I'm dependent to it) and fluoxetine as my anti depressive. This meds helps me no to go âuselessâ?but not really helping me to be happier.  And at this point I am really tired to try new meds or put more things into my body. I have smoked weed before, stopped because of my paranoia, and the alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs i rarely use them because I try to be as mentally healthy as possible, and I can barely handle their side effects. I tried psychedelics once in order to try to have an eye opening experience and overcome my traumas, but again, my paranoia made it worse. So I'm done with all the medics, gurus, substances, and all that.Right now I work as a Sales Manager in a multinational corporation, I graduated from a prestigious university, I rent an apartment, and from the outside you could tell that everything is fine. The thing is that even with my meds my bad days are heavier every time. I have social anxiety, (and work on sales, imagine that), in the last 5 years i barely go out from my house, my friends or colleges barely know about what happens to me, people always ask me where have you been all this time?? You disappear!! , because all I do is work and I'm so ashamed to go outside because I don't feel happy enough, worthy enough, rich enough, cool enough, handsome enough, that i prefer to stay at home doing nothing, and regretting it. I don't exercise, don't eat healthy, don't have any long time hobbies (although people think I do), I am gaining waight, loosing hair because of stress, failing and failing again on my attempts of getting my shit together. So my attacks are getting worse, can barely wake up, and when I do is because I'm too afraid to lose the job I hate. I have 5 really close friends that i count on, but I try not to contagious them with my negativity, i divorced from my parents since they are not a healthy relationship for me. I am only chid. And I feel so alone. Anyway, I'm here because ive always look for better ways to re-program my mind in order to heal/overcome my situation and be the best person I can. I want what I think most of us wants. To be happy and fulfill. To have great human interactions, financial independence, great health, athletic body, social life, romance, hobbies. All that... but I feel helpless..Ive tried to put morning habits, exercise routines, meditation practices (shakra, zhineng qigong, wim hof meditation, etc.) but all of those attempts feel like a greater defeat every time, and i am desperate because the problem is within me, and I'm waisting my life in my regretting and in my anger. My brain sabotages my body.. Have you passed over something similar and overcome it? How? Does anybody know a formula step by step to overcome this shit?What can I do to not to feel this miserable? Something I can put on work? How can I truly change the way I think???I lost hope but somehow I felt that this is the place to have the answers if I ask for the right questionsThank you all.I apologize for my English, it is not my first language.",0

394,"A Comprehensive Guide To Slowly Getting Better, And Not Losing Hope. : In no way am I an expert, and in no way have I mastered these points, but I have had depression for about 4 years now, and I have seen what works and what doesn't, and I wanted to share with you all my ideas for how to get healthy. Depending on the person, this list could include many different things, but I believe most of the things on this list could be helpful for most people on this sub. I write this because it makes me feel better, and because I like to help other people. It makes me less depressed. If someone, anyone, could glean anything from this list, I will be happy and grateful for it. Being in this fight with ourselves, we need others to help us, as we continue to help ourselves. In no way are these ordered from most important to least. In no way am I suggesting this is a cure for depression, but these are different ways to start to take control in the face of the inky dark face of depression and self-hatred. I do not see hope for myself, but I believe in it regardless. I hope you can too. **Exercise Daily -** Do something you like. It doesn't have to be the most intense, fat-burning, crazy workout. All I'm saying is try to go for a walk down the street and listen to what you hear. Go for a hike and appreciate the smells around you. Try out the gym for a couple months, aiming for small goals first, and then after you complete those goals, go for bigger ones. Try going and being active a couple times a week, and figure out what works for you, my friend. It can be anything from karate to chess (trust me, this actually burns a significant amount of calories!), from swimming to tennis, from hiking to punching a tree like a Shaolin Monk **Eat Healthy -** We always hear this one, and for good reason! It's simple, but it gets hard, doesn't it? We want to eat crap so we can feel a bit of pleasure every now and then. I'm not saying pizza is off the table forever, but I'm saying we need to make more small decisions for the majority of our meals. Try out different recipes with fruits and veggies and see what you come up with! Contrary to popular belief, healthy food CAN taste good. **Take Vitamins -**Many depressed people have low levels of Vitamin D (like me) so I take those regularly alongside some Magnesium supplements. I believe overtime this will help make small adjustments in my mood, and hopefully help swing the chemical imbalance a different way. **Take Meds If You Need Them -** Talk to someone. If they suggest pills, try them out. I have had pills that swung me the right way (Lexapro), and I have had pills that swung me a very, very bad way (some green looking pill, I don't remember what it was but I hated it dude). Everyone has different bodies, so this part might take awhile to figure out what works for you. Justâ?try it. I know it might feel weird to cross the threshold between not taking pills for depression and taking pills for depression, but man it could be a huge step in the right direction. Not a cure, but a step. **Journal -** This is a big one for me. I have kept up journaling ever since I was a wee lad, and it has really changed my life. Writing things down (like this) has a way of soothing the soul, I think. Write about what sucks, why it sucks, and what can be done about it. Write about the little good things that have happened today, and what you hope to happen. Write down prayers, thoughts, dreams, cries of anger and defeat, and tears of joy; hopefully at some point. **Clean Your Room -** I suck at this, but there's something about your room being clean that helps you feel a bit better about yourself. Put your clothes away, make your bed, and even try to make it smell nice for once. Get a candle or a defuser, put up some christmas lights, and make it your own personal spot and hide out. You'll feel better, trust me. **Read -** This is one of those that might not work the same for everyone, but I do believe we should all try to read a book we have been itching to read once in a while. No, not a book that you hope will make you look educated or niche, but a book that makes you sigh with relief when you open it up. Read Matilda for all I care! I read that book in one toilet session and I felt GREAT the rest of the day. **Go Outside Once a Day -** All I'm saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the âfunkâ?it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something.   **General Hygiene -** Big one. This is good for your body as a whole, but also for your mind. You'll hate yourself less if you have taken care of yourself a bit in the last week or so. Take a shower, brush your teeth, get a haircut, trim your beard, de-odor yourself, whatever! You'll feel slightly better if you look and smell better. **Sleep Well -** I'm talking 8 hours at night and not throughout the day. Don't waste the day away by taking little naps all the time. Do your work, work hard, and go to bed exhausted. You will feel better. You won't be cured, but you'll feel better. Your body needs this, friend. **Wake Up Early -** Again, this might not be for everyone (as a matter of fact, who IS it for really), but trust me when I say that almost EVERY TIME I wake up early and do some stuff I like, the rest of the day feels better because I did something productive at the start of it. I get this sense of pride and secret accomplishment that no one else knows about, and it's great! **Be Wise With Money -** I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect a lot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I'm telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction. **Compliment People, Spread Positivity, Without Expecting Anything in Return -** This is a great one. Even if you don't believe the same things about yourself, tell them to other people. Everyone needs to hear that they are beautiful, that they are wanted, that they are noticed and seen. Here's the catch: don't do it for your own gain. Do it because you have a good heart, somewhere in you. You want to see others smile as much as you want to see yourself smile, regardless of what your personal demons say otherwise. **Don't Stay in Your House or Room for Too Long (Poor timing on this one, I know. But go for a walk or something) -** This comes at an awkward timing, but at least get out of your bed and be productive with something. My worst days are when I'm just scrolling Reddit or Pornhub or Facebook and when I'm justâ?wasting myself away. Get out of your room, be productive, do something. **Serve Other People in Some Way -** This is a bit different from complimenting people, but the premise is the same. Help others. Join a non-profit organization and help out once a week. You meet great people, you gain experience with something new, and you help your fellow man. There's nothing like it! You are DOING something amazing, even if it is small. You are helping others, and man you are helping yourself. Do something you are new at, and give it a couple months until you try something new. This could REALLY change your life, as it has mine. **Get Together With Friends -** Get together, at least once a week or so with someone or some people that you care about. Whether it's at a coffee shop, over a video game, at church, ANYTHING. Just have some contact with people and remind them that you are thankful for them. This may be difficult for some, as it has been for me a couple years ago (and all of high school too), but try it out. The right people will come, I'm sure of it. **Call Family -** Whatever family you have, try to be in contact with them over text or call. It has taken me many years to realize the power of a supportive family, and one of the great evils of this world is the breakdown of the family through cheating, divorce, disconnection, abuse; anything that rips a family apart is a terrible thing. But sometimes you need to be the person who tries to bring the family back together, because we all need each other. **Listen to Music -** Duh! We all have that one or couple artists that really just speak to us. For me it's Coldplay and a little known artist named Chris Renzema. They have been with me through ups and downs (lots of downs). I also listen to William Augusto Instrumentals as I fall asleep each night. Very helpful. **Try Out Therapy for a Couple Months -** It can be scary, I know. And for me personally therapy didn't even fully work out for me. But this doesn't mean I didn't try it. I tried it for a few months and eventually just stopped because I didn't feel any differently. This won't be the same for everyone. At least try it out, and it may be a big help to you, friend. **Limit Screen Time if you Can Help it -** Less time on the phone, less time on the computer, less time on the TV. All great things, but all things should be taken into moderation, yes? Find a schedule that works for you. I personally am trying to lower my screentime on my phone to 5 hours a day, and eventually to 2 hours. Small goals, one step at a time. **Make Daily To-Do Lists -** Most days, in the morning or the day before, I create a to-do list to organize and plan for the day ahead. I even put small things like brushing my teeth on there to make me feel better about what I accomplished and so I can put a little checkmark besides it! **Take Care of a Pet -** I recently got a Bearded Dragon (his name is Henry), and it has given me something new to live for and protect. As someone who yearns for a wife and kids, feeling like a dad really gives me joy and helps me stay motivated. Many of you have cats and dogs, and that is fantastic. Send me pictures of them so I can tell you how cute they are. **Be In Nature -** I believe this is for everyone. Get outside when you can, even if it is crappy outside, and try to appreciate what you see. Try to travel to a National Park at some point, and take in the sights. Go for a short hike and look at the trees. We are on this planet to enjoy what is around us, as we strive to protect and appreciate it. **NoFap, NoPorn -** I know, many people may not agree with me here. I fail in this aspect alot, so I am not saying I am immune to the allure to porn and masturbation, but I'm telling you guys that life is better without it. I went a year without it once, and seriously it made a HUGE difference. I believe that we can love our fellow humans better without Porn or Masturbation.  You may disagree, but I stay by this conviction. **Practice Gratitude -** Stay thankful for the things that you have. Whether it be your health, your family, your belongings, your warm bed, anything. Just remember all the things you are thankful for, and try to stop being so cynical. Again, I do this too, so let's get better together. *Now, I am a devout Protestant Christian, and I wanted to include my Christian side to this equation. This is the most important part of my life, and it is the single biggest reason I am still alive right now, healthy enough to write and hope that others and myself can get better, step by step.* **Pray (For Others and Yourself) -** Thank the Lord for the people around you. Voice your anger towards Him. Talk to Him throughout the day, Ask Him to reveal Himself to you and to show you how much He truly loves you. He will do it, for a good Father wants His sons and daughters to be comforted in the midst of a crooked and twisted place that we live.**Read The Bible -** This is the thing upon which we compare everything else. This is my source of wisdom and compassion, as the Lord speaks to His people through His Word. Learn, listen, and speak encouragement to others as you learn from the goodness of the One who Loves us. **Meditate -** Christians meditate too! Take time in silence and align yourself with the Holy Spirit, as He speaks encouragement and direction into you, always being ready to compare what you hear to scripture to determine truth. **Get Together with Church Community -** Get together with others. Ask your questions. Break bread. Share stories. Encourage one another. Learn from the lesson preached by the pastor. Learn. Listen. Grow. Love.All I'm saying is 15 minutes. At least. You can manage that. There are days where I self-isolate for hours in my room, and in order to get out of the âfunkâ?it is always helpful to just go outside with some tea and listen. Go to a park, walk to a coffee shop, walk down your street, go for a hike. Just DO something. Take time alone and listen to the beautiful songs of worship made by thousands of different artists that have gone through depression and find release in Jesus name, or are still depressed this side of eternity and are still trusting in the direction of the One who gave it all for them. ***Hope, my friends. Hope. Take steps to better yourself. Give yourself grace. Keep trying. Hope, my friends. Hope.***",0
395,"I don't think college is right for me : TW: suicide mentionWhen I (18F) graduated high school, I had no idea where I wanted to go. I skipped the fall semester and found an online college to join for the spring. The semester is wrapping up and I'm miserable. I only took three classes but it still feels overwhelming. I'm not doing well in any of them, but I can't bring myself to tell anyone. I started going to therapy only to stop after three weeks because it wasn't helping. I take antidepressants but they also don't seem to be helping. I write in a diary every night, so I have a place to write down my feelings, but even that doesn't help me anymore.I haven't been sleeping well at all since classes started in January. The other night while I was lying there, I was seriously debating suicide. The only thing that stopped me was worrying about how it would affect my sisters (9 + 15 years old). I feel so hopeless and confused right now, but getting this out feels really nice. Any advice/kind words?",0

I've got assignments and online classes going on and a long list of lectures to listen to in a subject I absolutely hate. I eat two meals a day since I wake up at odd hours (sometimes 6pm, sometimes 1pm, sometimes 4pm) and my body can't adjust to my sleep schedule. I feel worse ever since I've gotten this serious insomnia because not only does it make me feel horrible for not being able to sleep when I'm sad and tired, it's preventing me from being a physically healthy person. I've had a Napoleon complex for too long and my father told me our family has always been a long line of late bloomers. I really need the sleep and the food to grow. But I just can't have them. When I wake up, it's always to sit in front of my laptop and listen to lectures I hate listening to at 2x speed and 0 comprehension. Recently, my vision definitely got worse and my hair is falling out too. My brain can't seem to function well I'm misreading stuff and making simple grammatical mistakes in my writing/daily convo. Someone please help, what is wrong with me? I just want to be happy, healthy and normal. Thanks for reading. Sorry if I don't reply, I'm really tired.

397,"With each passing day my depression is getting worse and worse, I don't know what I'm going to do : I've been having problems with depression for a while now, starting since around 6th grade. It wasn't too bad, it didn't affect me too severely, but I didn't know how to handle it. I never learned how to. So I kept everything to myself. I never reached out, I never asked for help, I didn't want to bother anybody. Over the years, it has been gradually getting worse and worse, I started hating myself and everything else more and more, I started having these terrible thoughts. I had no clue what to do. I kept doing what I had always done, not tell anyone. Act like I could do it on my own. Here I am, in 10th grade, feeling the worse I have ever felt. My grades have been dropping, even when we were in school and now in online school, my dad has abandoned the family to cheat on my mom, my grandpa has died, my mom is in complete shambles, and here I am stuck at home, laying in bed for hours each morning, eating so little food. These thoughts of me hating myself and thinking horrible things has become normal, I'm used to it, I've accepted that I'm a bad person. And the worst part is I finally did reach out, about a month ago. I'm seeing a therapist now. My mom (somewhat) knows what's happening. And I feel absolutely no different than I did before. None of it is helping, it's as if I did nothing. And I'm scared. I feel like I'll never get better, that it'll only get worse from here. I feel like I'm going to drive everyone away from me. I feel like I'll do awful things. I don't know what will happen. I just want everything to be fine. But how do I know that'll ever happen?",0

401,"My story I guess : Hi, Im from Germany and my english is mostly self learned, so please excuse if I do anything wrong. So here it goes:I've been depressed for 4 years now and I'm only 16 and because I have no one in real life to talk to, I thought I'll just post it here. My story starts with me being 12 years old and my best friend talking shit about me and telling I was a fake friend without me doing anything. For some reason he is still my best friend but he changed now luckily. That was the original cause of my depression. I never told anyone of my family about this tho. Things started to get normal again but I suffered from serious trust issues and it also made me socially awkward.Since then I cant talk to new people without swetting and being stressed in general. I can only find new friends if the person is already friends with one of my friends. Yeah so this experience fucked my head and now I'm always scared of people leaving me and at the slightest sign of someone acting not normal, i freak out and get even more depressed and because of my social abilities I'm not even brave enough to ask them wich has also been a problem. I never told anyone about all of this because I am scared they would not care. This is also because of my best friend because he told me ""You can talk with me about everything because I don't care"". That basically doesnt sound that bad, but it still ruined my self esteem. Nobody except one of my friend knows about this. He has also depression but he said that he doesnt understand me because my life is so great. I never talked to him about depression after that. I started listening to ""goth"" music I guess. I listen to people like guccihighwaters, convolk, gothurted and guardin but my problem with them is that I wish I could relate. I can relate with the pain but not with the heart brake since I never had a girlfriend and honestly I dont think I'm worth loving. I changed schools recently and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. It's been 4 months since the change and I have made 3 friends by now. It's basically a good accomplishment but I did not made them myself it's just because of a friend of mine that also changed schools. I'm still feeling alone in school tho because I again think everybody doesnt like me and just pretends to like me to be friendly. But if I think about this I feel bad for thinking this because these people are so nice. The reason I didnt tell my family about anything of this is because nearly everybody of my family is depressed so again I feel like I am just a burden if I tell them about it so I just spend time alone in my room. Right now its already the 1st of January and I spend the night alone listening to music and crying. I dont know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like if my social skills dont get better I wont accomplish anything in the future. I wont get a job, a girlfriend, a family. Everyday I wish I would have never been born or to end myself. But if I end myself my mother would probably brake down or even worse.I dont know if this was interesting or anything like that, maybe someone can relate and doesnt feel so alone. Anyways I hope that you will do better than me in 2020 and that you are doing fine.",1

I'm her only daughter and we are very close. But I'm clueless as to how to live with this fog that has followed me since my teenage years, especially if I don't have her in my life.It's as if the depression becomes heavier the older I get, despite the sertraline and hours and hours of therapy.

404,"Fuck 2019 : Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.",1

407,"Empty and stuck in a loop every day : In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games.

And the cycle continues. Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view.

423,How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It's started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won't say which cause it's not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you're crazy or you're stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don't know I don't want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,1

I feel conflicted cause I feel horrible, but the alcohol is making me feel good. I don't usually drink so this is a new feeling.

Now I'm on the toilet with anxiety and diarrhea because my mom causes me so much stress. I was hoping tonight would go well too. I went to my fiancees house to visit with his mom and dad for a few hours. I told my mom I would be home by 8. I talked to her on the phone while I was there and told her more like 730. Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, "" where are you it's after 8!"" While it is literally 8:03 mind you. When we get to my house I break down crying. She tells me the usual. I'm sorry, I love you, I didn't mean to make you cry."" I try to explain that just because you stab someone doesn't mean you want them dead. It's the same logic. She says then that what about the times when I do things to her and she has to accept my apologies? Like, I'm your fucking daughter, wtf. Anyway I'm just so fed up with everyone. I feel so depressed when I'm home. When I'm with my fiancee I feel better. And honestly, I feel like I have diarrhea from all this stress. Fuck this.",1

429,"It's an hour into the new year, new decade for me : And I already feel lost. Completely hopeless, and I'm wondering what baggage I've dragged from 2019 into 2020. Unwillingly and unexpectedly, and I've tried my best not to, but some things are just attached; a living part of you. A monster you wish didn't exist; feeding off solely you. A separate living entity that's attached itself like a conjoined twin. If you try to cut it off with expert help, - and even then its 50/50 - you'll bleed out an die very fucking quickly.  Mental health help is either going to save me or confirm that everything is shot for everybody. Nothing ever gets better apart from those lucky few who get to hold a beacon of light for the blind unfortunate to follow.The year has already started with financial woes. Absolutely no security, and feeling emotionally rejected. Being an unpaid carer is a selfless thing - everybody tells me - but it's so worthwhile. Right?Managed to find Â£11 for a bottle of spirits to try and make me forget for the night, but instead I find myself simmering in a pot of self-loathing than not even alcohol can lessen. That Â£11 could have gone towards food and heating, you stupid fucking moron. I'm already done with 2020. Why do I continue to care in a world that doesn't care less about me. It's already proved it'll keep spinning without me. It feels like my true value to people would only be reached if I were dead. My brothers and family would only realise how much I actually do, if I were swimming at the bottom of the reservoir. Body full of alcohol, pockets full of stones.Once I stop being the umbrella that catches people's rainfall of shit, will I finally be liked and missed? Will they be sorry I spent christmas alone, barely able to afford heating? Will my brothers realise that while I sacrifice every passing chance of a better life, out of breadline Britain and the poverty we grew up in, they live a relatively easy life ignorong their dying, immobile, stroke-ridden mother? All the while, I have the pleasure of watching her slowly kill herself through mental health problems and physical health obstacles.I dont feel like I can do another decade of this. I cant do this anymore.",1
430,"2019 was my worst year with 2 depression crisis. I'm happy it ended but so afraid of what 2020 will bring. : This years was rough. It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again. During all of these I had to leave university for the year as I couldn't deal with the pression at the time. The thing is I study Industrial Engineer and I'm working as a Marketing E   Commerce Analyst for Dell.com.br. I don't know if I want to keep with my engineering program, but I'm not that away from finishing it. Long story short, I'm lost and don't know what to expect from 2020.

439,"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let's just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn't deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they're so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I've given away money and belongings. I've even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don't know what kind of response I'm looking for with this post, I'm more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading",1

I can't say I'm suicidal nor have suicidal thoughts because I don't want to get sectioned. It's unfortunate that I have to lie but I know my fate. Everyone is getting married, having kids, getting their careers, finding peace...I'm still not over my dads death. Nor the fact I got used, or the fact I was manipulated. But hey it was all me. I read the self help books and I know it's my fault. Again I can't kill myself but if i could, it would be for that reason. I'm not suicidal nor do I want to die, but I can't get out of this downward spiral. I know there's no hope no cure. Depression is situationally brought on. I wasn't always this way but circumstances have brought me here. I'm not making sense since I'm just writing off the top of my head so I'll stop now. I have tried to change based off of what my influencers tell me, off of what my therapist tells me, of what society tells me-and I've accepted I'm doomed.",1

No matter how much I study, I only get C's and D's I am NOT happy with because I expected to get at least a B or something.My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.The therapist's appointment is on January 16th, but I can't sleep, it's 3:43AM for me right now, the New Year has already started and I had to write this now.

450,"Dont Know What To Say : I dont really know what to say. Feeling kind of depressed right now but I havent had anyone to vent to and usually never do so I dont really know how to talk about it. I just feel so alone in this world. I feel myself getting further and further away from my family. I thought if I had a job and was making decent money I would start feeling better cause I could move out and get all the things I wanted but still cant afford to move out and despite all my belongings they cant fill this void. My parents divorce has made this whole problem worse even after 3 years of them being divorced. My soon to be stepdad is telling my mom that I steal from her and she believes it. And what makes it worse is that when I graduated high school I recieved $15,000 from my grandpa and once my parents divorced I used all of that money to help my mom out with bills and just taking care of my mom and sister since my dad doesnt do it. I spend so much of my time and money taking care of other people and I never ask for anything in return. There just seems to be no way out of any of this. It's so expensive just for me to move out, I'm trapped with no where to go.I have no friends, literally no one that I can talk to. The reason for this? I've got no idea, I think its because I dont do parties or anything like that. Its just not my style and no one really likes that. My love life hasn't be the greatest either. I dated this girl all throughout high school and a year into college we broke up and I just havent felt the same about dating since. Now I just fuck around and dont do any of the dating shit. My Hope's and dreams didnt really pan out either.  The beginning of my senior year of high school I found out I was color blind and couldn't fly for the military. This was something that I had planned out for years, took pilots lessons and everything. All my eggs thrown into one basket and crushed in an instant. So that threw my whole after high school plans down the drain.Honestly everything has taken a massive down hill turn after I graduated high school. Parents got divorced, lost my best friend, lost my girlfriend, lost the only thing I ever wanted to do which was to fly. Now I'm stuck in this small town working this dead end job and nowhere to run to. Sorry for the long rant. I'm sure most of what I've said is stupid and I should just forget it all and move on and tough it out. I just dont have anyone to talk to so I needed to vent.",1

453,"Another shitty new year. : I think it's fair to say that the past few years (since 2014 or so) each year got gradually worse and worse. Now here we are. 2020. I'm at an all-time high of depression, loneliness, and other issues I won't bore you with. Most people seem to have high hopes for this upcoming year, and the little bit of hope I actually have agrees. However, seeing as how things are and how things have been for the past few years, I can't help but think pessimistically about the upcoming year. So, until we've gotten far enough into 2020 for me to determine which it is, I'll try my best to remain on an indifferent feeling toward the new year, and I hope you can all do the same for a while. Until then, I'm all alone and I'm very sad and lonesome on New Years yet again. I'm not even gonna bother watching the ball drop, it just doesn't feel special anymore. Let's all hope that 2020 brings on new opportunities and new positivity into all our lives. I invite anybody to take a shot with me as the clock strikes midnight.

I just act like that because sit helps me get away from my feelings and how I'mfeeling. My girlfriend moved to Florida and she was honestly the only thing that made me happy and actually cherish life. But now... I'm just depressed and fucking wish I wasn't here. I'm just stressed about school and I don't have anyone to just go to and hug when I need to, I never have and I doubt I ever will.

458,"i thought 2019 was going to be the end of my depression lmao : disclaimer: this post kinda makes it sounds like i'm over dramatizing things but idc this is just how i feel right nowI've been depressed since the latter half of 2017, so like 2 years which isn't a long time, but given my age (16), it feels like forever. From the beginning until this fall, I felt like I was trapped in a box of numbness; I felt sorta sad, but I didn't feel enough to ""kick"" myself out of the depression fog. I would have brief waves of euphoria (which I treasure(d) greatly), but I would always relapse into numbness. Most days, I had a hard time imagining what happiness or having fun felt like, even in ""fun"" situations like dances and parties. On the weekend of Halloween 2019, I hit a new low after being witnessing people making plans without me and having fun while I cried in my room. I thought it was all my fault so I ended up texting a couple friends ""do you think I push people away?"". For some reason, opening up really helped me. After a few days I felt like I could feel things again. I became way more social and I felt like I was strengthening my relationships with all my friends. I could finally actively participate in group conversations without social anxiety. I was just a normal, happy person. My grades and my art improved too. Although I had several mental breakdown usually due to school stress and bad grades, people were there for me. Plus, I would much rather have extreme emotional highs and lows over numbness. 2019 was also the year where I finally realized I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse. After doing some research I found out I wasn't alone and that it wasn't my fault. Even though before I had waves of temporary happiness, I felt like I entered a new chapter where depression would be behind me. but NOPE. I got vectored. Since winter break started I feel like shit again. I've been taking depression naps every day. I invited a few friends over for a sleepover but the entire time I felt like I was watching them have fun while I watched from the outside, unable to share their joy. I was invited to one NYE party but I can't go because I couldn't get a ride from any of my friends and I failed my driving test today so I can't take myself. So I will be spending NYE alone for the 4th year in a row. Hopefully things will get better after the semester starts.It's just so weird that a month ago, I almost forgot what depression felt like and now I don't know what happiness feels like. ughAnyways, happy new years guys and I hope 2020 is better for all of us",1

But now it's the last two hours of the year and my parents are watching something else, my brother is playing video games and I'm stuck in the basement feeling sorry for myself.  The last hours and I'm depressed. I'm going to start the new year depressed. Sometimes I hate that I have hope... it somehow hurts me moreOnce it's 12:00 I'm gonna go to bed, listen to music while staring up at the ceiling just letting depression take over, like usual.",1
465,"Changed my life for the better, still miserable : This year, not only did I finally get my ged, after wasting 5 years of my life doing nothing, I lost weight, got myself my first job, put my self out there, started socializing more, had sex, and some how i still feel utterly alone, tierd, depressed and all around miserable. Wasted 5 years , and in those 5 years I stopped feeling bad, but then again I was literally doing nothing. Now that I'm getting my life together somewhat, it feels like I'm opening a wound that will never heal and just feeling all the pain again.",1

467,scared of hurting myself if i get drunk : so i turn 18 in a couple of days and it feels fucking weird saying that because when i was 13 i could not imagine my life past 16 or 17 and it's very hard to wrap my head around that i'm actually here right now despite how much i wish i wasn't. to celebrate my bday a small group of friends and i are having a party but i'm terrified to let myself get properly drunk. i've only drunk alcohol once or twice and have only gotten a bit tipsy for me that meant more friendly loud singing coming out of my shell. but that same night i only had 3ish drinks i found myself in my friends bathroom looking for something to sh with and just sitting on the floor spacing out. as much as i do want to die i don't want to do in a way that's harmful to my friends but i do wanna get drunk and force myself to have fun bc that's what you're supposed to do. but i just have this gut feeling that i will do something about ending my life if i drink a bunch bc the only thing now stopping me is just the courage and that's literally the only thing alcohol gives me. i don't really know what the point of posting this is it's just a vent but maybe if anyone else has dealt w this,1

I'm 24, jobless, and still living with my parents. I'm looking for jobs but none have called me back, and I feel like a failure when I realize most people my age have moved out and (mostly) have their shit together. I'm also terrified of driving which really limits my independence. I'm going to school and like to think I'm trying to better myself, but it seems like everything I do is all for nothing. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever been in a situation similar to mine? If you read this far, thank you  for your time. All this may not seem like a big deal but it has me feeling utterly powerless and worthless.",1

Yeah New Years is just another day... but it's another day i have to spend alone,1

I know I have a good heart. But its not enough is it. You need to feel part of something. Companionship. I was a good looking young person. Now I am not young. Now I am not good looking.

474,"Am I depressed or is this just a rough patch(vent) : This is probably going to sound stupid but I don't know if I should seek help because of how i've been feeling lately or if this is just a rough time and it'll get better over time. Long story that i'm attempting to make short, my grandpa had a stroke over the summer and now he's in hospice, slowly declining every day. It's caused a lot of tension in the family for many reasons as one can imagine. My grandma has also been having vision problems, so she hasn't been driving. Because of that, i've had to drive an hour home from college every Tuesday to go grocery shopping for her, run errands, etc., since our family is so small and the only other relatively closeby person is my mom who works all the time. Now my grandma is getting surgery in a couple days so my grandpa is getting moved to a nursing home for a week since she can't take care of him, and just the thought of being is that place is making me feel sick. Don't get me wrong, I love my grandfather and I want to keep him company, but I feel like i'm just watching him slowly die. It's taking such a fucking toll on my mental health. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep. Not to mention my parents are divorced, my mom is a borderline alcoholic, my brother is autistic &amp; it's been very hard trying to get him a job (he's 24 and it's all he asks about). He's even been asking me if he can live with me when i'm older and ready to move out of my moms house. It's all just too much and i don't even know where my heads at. I didn't mean to make this post THAT long but I just don't know what I should do. Should I seek help? Or will everything get better over time ....",1
475,"parents suck : I'm very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn't really affect me except for with my family. I'm not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I'm annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they âdon't see me as much as they used toâ? Basically I can't do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don't avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ânot be annoyed as muchâ? which really can't be done. On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we're currently in and spent the night outside (we're on a ski vacation, it get's below -15Â°C here at night). Said I have to go to therapy for being annoyed (I've went to therapy before, it really did not work for me). My mother joined in and asked why I couldn't just be a normal child.

I got my GED instead then that was it. Slowly but surely lost all my friends over that time, but somehow got a girlfriend during that time whom I've been with for almost 7 years now. Sometimes I feel I put too much dependency on her. Anyway, I just feel that at my age I should be somewhere else. I still live with my dad, I never went to college, I don't have friends, I've lost all social skills I used to have. Any time I'm around people (which is really fucking rare) I shut down and can't connect so I stay inside like always. This new year I plan to go to community college when he spring semester starts but I'm worried I'll bail out of it like I usually do.

I've asked on Facebook, I've looked online. And that's it just another Nye alone by myself without a single fuck from anyone. It's hard enough dealing with depression and not using as it is.

There's a tradition called ""Watch Night"" in the city I've lived in for eight and a half years, and I scanned the place to find someone I knew so we could hang out. No one I knew was there. I wanted to call a friend, and she didn't answer the house phone (and was a bit miffed that I tried to call twice). It seems petty, but given that I overthink everything, what should be a festive holiday seems now like a black hole. I feel like 128 lbs of dirt, with a stomach full of McDonald's.

Even though these feelings are fleeting, almost momentary, they have been more and more present and appearing frequently. I have gone through a bad breakup a few months ago, I got rear ended by a truck and was forced to get a new car, and I moved to a new apartment and had to buy essentially all new furniture. So I understand that I am also in a period of transition and that could certainly effect my mindset.

I've got a primary doctor picked out (haven't had one in like five years) and a therapist picked out. I just can't work up the guts to make the appointments. I'm absolutely terrified that I'll talk to the doctor about it and they'll deny me getting antidepressants and that therapy won't help. If I try and it fails then that's the final nail in the coffin, there's no hope because I tried so much already. And there's the looming possible weight gain. I'm 5â?â?female and 205lbs. I went from a very fit 142lbs (26% body fat) in 2015 to 205lbs (42% body fat) and out of shape now. I know how to eat well and I love exercising but I just can't anymore. I despise how I look already so being super depressed sounds better than continuing to gain weight. How am I supposed to walk into a new doctor and be like âhey, doc. I'm super depressed and anxious as fuck. How about some antidepressants? Oh and none that'll make me gain weight.

I know, it's stupid, but yeah it's about a girl. basically I'm in a whole new province for my winter break (still a high school student) and the girl I've been talking to is staying at home for the break which is where I normally live. I've only gotten to communicate with her through Snapchat and it went well for a bit until I told her about my feelings and she said that she kind of felt the same way about me but there was also someone else. a week and a half have gone by and I've noticed as the days continue she loses more interest in me. I'm pretty sure she's into the other guy now who happens to be one of her exes. It's just been making me sad because when I like a girl I really really like her and it's hard for me to stop. that's why when they don't like me bad I have a hard time coping with the fact that they don't like me back. this girl I like is special in many ways I could honestly go on forever and describe how perfect she is. that's why it's hard knowing she doesn't like me. she's going to a New Years party in my hometown with the guy she likes and I'm not sure what's gonna happen, it's just been irritating me very much, I have no one to talk to. I'm in a huge hotel with my family and they're all drunk, my friends are either busy or at parties, I've come to this chat to talk, I feel kinda pathetic for some reason. anyways, that's how I'm going to end my decade. feeling depressed about a girl that's in a different province than me. very pathetic. hopefully someone that's either dumb enough to want to listen to my story or is just curious to read this or for some reason ends up reading all of this, hopefully they can say something back, I just want to hear something from someone that isn't my own conscious. now I'm just getting vibes that I want to badly die, I know I'm not suicidal but I just want life to stop for a very long time so I can have a break from everything. that's about all I had to say, it's New Years in 2 minutes. again hopefully someone sees this. happy New Years to everyone that sees this and everyone in general I guess. goodnight",1

523,"Watching the ball drop brings : A plethora of emotions. Sadness, fear, jealousy of all the people having a good time while wearing a diaper in the middle of Times Square, etc every year. I want 2020 to go well but I don't think I'll ever stop being this sad.",1
524,"Worst day of the year for me : Every year I'm alone and drunk hating my life debating whether to end it. I'm constantly in a hole, deep down wanting to change but never do. Better to be in a deep sleep than my life of constant failure.",1
525,"meh : i wish i didnt see reality as it is. i wish i had some goals to achieve, some sort of purpose, happiness would be cool too. instead im always by myself 24/7 even if im with other people, and thats it. it makes me sad, that a decade has passed. life goes by so quick its insane i don't wanna feel happy at this point, so no meds for me. reality sucks, and i just have to get used to facing it everyday. i question if this reality isn't hell, because sometimes it feels like life is just out to get me. i sometimes worry about going to hell, but what if this is hell? the funny thing is that i dont mean jack shit. theres 7 billion people here. not to mention in the observable universe i am literally just a speck. however my brain doesn't see it like this. life is a huge mind-fuck. x  10000000000000000000",1
526,being alive is fucking exhausting : [removed],1
527,"2020, New Year, New Nothing special : This year has been my worst year and to be honest I dont even remember the first 6 months and all the years before it, just a smudge and small memories, but what I do remember is it being a hateful, depressing, anxiety fueled life, my ex keeps wanting me back, my brother is a pos, my mom is always angry, I'm always sad angry and overworked, nothing has gone right But I dont have the ""2020! New year new me! Resolutions! New life!"" Emotion, I just feel Oh it's a new decade, 2020, coolBut for some reason I just have a pit of sadness Everywhere I look its ""2019 was amazing, so much joy, so much life, love, everything!"" But nothing has happened to me I've been sitting in the dark, listening to music for the last 20 or 30 minutesI wish I didnt have to live into 2020 but to a new year, new disappointments, just another day, just another year",1
528,Overwhelmed by how little I feel : I've become emotionally numb to the sorts of moments that seemingly used to be exempt from my depression and it's creating this antsy discomfort in me during moments like watching the new year's ball drop where I expect to have a brief respite and instead just continue to feel nothing.The emptiness is oddly jarring even though it's a common guest throughout my day to day life. I think that in the past even though I generally had that distance from everything I would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it isn't happening anymore it just  sends me into this lost confused state instead - like when you're absent-mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sense.,1
529,"People in this world : I hate when people say you should be happy. You should be grateful that you're alive, grateful that you're breathing. But what if I didn't ask to be alive. I'm not happy. I understand I should be because people have it worse but there's nothing I can do about it. Why not just let me live the life I never asked for. You should be grateful I'm not selfish enough to kill myself. I've tried multiple times staying under the limit. If I really really wanted to I'd be dead already. JUST LET ME LIVE MY OWN LIFE",1

532,Happy NYE : It's just one more year closer until I kill myself.,1
533,Has anyone tried meditation for depression? : My dear friend shared meditative mind with me and it's seemed to help so much with handling everything. Anyone else have success with meditation? https://youtu.be/C8KpA0b1_6M,1
534,Plushcare? : Has anyone used Plushcare to get a prescription for antidepressants or anxiety meds for the first time? I'm thinking of using it after the new year when my new insurance kicks in but want to hear others experience. My insurance (Capital Blue) also has a service just like Plushcare but I don't really know much about it.,1
535,"I sometimes feel like it's not depression : Keep in mind I've not been diagnosed but its pretty cookie cutter depression. But recently I've really been thinking about it and I'm just so sensitive and I don't really know how to stop it. I will flip my lid over things I'm not even upset over. I'll have breakdowns about something and then be perfectly fine after. It just feels like I'm not in control of my emotions but not to the extent of bipolar? It's been this way since I was a kid and the strongest emotion has always either been anger or soul crushing sadness. I've tried meditations and all that self help shit but it's so on the spot idk how to stop it from happening. It really runs my life because I don't ever leave my comfort zone or its a guaranteed meltdown. I want to live again. I don't wanna be upset all the fucking time. I want to know I'll come home watch some tv like I knew I wanted instead of dissociating halfway through the first episode and all of a sudden hit a low because I'm by myself. How dare I be by myself, even tho that's all I want all day. This is just word vomit and I'm so sorry I just don't know where else to put my thoughts.",1
536,"I thought I had it under control : I've been feeling better, truly. I started taking my medication correctly, stopped drinking, started doing things I enjoyed. And then my life went to shit. My boyfriend and I broke up (we didn't love each other anymore), I moved farther away from my mom, I got into legal trouble, my grandmother suffered her 3rd stroke, I spent Thanksgiving alone. My grandmother almost died again. I spent Christmas alone. My ex got a new girlfriend, and I don't care much about that, but more about the fact that as a friend, I apparently no longer exist to him. I feel as though my family and friends are all so unreachable and nobody seems to understand when I tell them. I'm spending nye alone. 3 holidays in a row and I can shake this feeling that I'm slowly slipping back into old habits. I don't leave my bed if I don't have to work, I'm barely eating, and I let my room get a mess. I had a scary thought today. I've never been suicidal before, but today it sounded nice. I guess I don't have it as under control as I thought I did....",1
537,"Plain spaghetti for dinner. : Today I spent a lot of time thinking about how I should kill myself and whether or not it was the correct choice. My New Year's date changed his mind last night, so I'm staying home alone. After work I bought a car with all my savings (which were intended to buy a car). Now I'm home. I'm out of food and I'm going to have plain whole grain spaghetti with butter and the cheese I have left for dinner. That's all I've got.&amp;#x200B;Don't know if anyone else had a weird day, but cheers. Happy 2020.",1

540,"My antidepressants used to work. : I've been on antidepressants for ten months. I'm seeing two therapists and one psychologist because my family is skeptical about depression. The therapist I see more told me my dad was abusive but I felt weird about it so I denied it. I haven't seen my dad in two years so I've been visiting my dad and family for the last two weeks. I see him treating my siblings the way he treated me and any small thing I do, such as telling him I'm hungry, angers him to the point of raising his voice and accusing me of lying. My old feelings and depression symptoms are back. I feel like life is a waste because my depression isn't situational, everyone's life is worse when I'm around despite people telling me the opposite I think they're lying, I'm pathologically crying again (I won't think about anything that makes me sad and but I'll start crying), and I have no appetite. I'm already at a really high dose so I hope this is temporary.",1

They never let me even go inside my friends houses, ONCE. They're racist shits saying Americans are the ones who put my brothers in jail. And so what my parents are telling me is my friends will also arrest me?On top of that they force me to go to events I don't want to relaying with religion. And not so long ago I spoke out to a counselor they use to abuse me. They closed the case after 2 weeks.I'm done. I don't want to kill my self because I believe in my religion and that killing myself will only put me in a darker place.

I don't know why I'm here, I'm usually not one to show any emotion, or ask for help, I've always been mild and even tempered. Lately I've really been struggling though, I deleted my social media's weeks ago, due to negative interactions, before that I ditched long running games I'd played on my phone, the idea behind that was so that I could focus more time on my family without distractions. I had a drastic shift change at work and I knew time with them was going to be at a premium already and I didn't want meaningless things taking away from them. My wife struggles with her own anxiety and depression, I don't want to lump mine on to hers when I don't full understand it myself, even though to a certain degree I already do, I removed familiar comfort distractions and I never replaced them with constructive creative outlets like I intended. I cut out the empty but never replaced it with anything meaningful, the things that distracted me from the monotony are gone, but all I have right now is the monotonous day in day out. I know my wife sees it, she's called me out on it, but I shrug it off and say I'm tired. I love my family but right now I feel just feel drained. More than anything I think I just needed to say this, if only to try and shake myself out of apathy.",1
571,"The only thing more depressing then being alone on new years : I wasnt supposed to be alone. Mu best friend ditched me to go to a party with her ex that im not invited to because her ex hates me. Noone besides that friend wished me a happy new year. None of my so called ""friends"" bothered to even text me. All i can think is if i killed myself right here right now how long would it take till someone found me. Days maybe weeks hell maybe they wouldnt notice until my body started to smell. Its not like anyone checks up on me. The only thing stopping me is my best friend would think its her fault. Noone deserves to be the person that couldve been there to save you right. I was that person when my old best friend killed herself. Its a shitty feeling but it wouldnt be wrong if i hadnt been ditched i wouldnt feel so alone and betrayed. Is this what 2020 is gunna be am i just gunna watch everyone walk away from me until im utterly alone.",1
572,"What a way to start the new year : It's funny I find myself thinking, why am I alive ? Why can't i be dead yet. But I made a resolution. I'm going to start marking my days as good or bad.

574,"Just talking and rambling on idk : Hey everyone, I mainly just came to post my thoughts and read whatever anyone says or see if anyone has similar experiences or feels the same. Today was probably one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was really looking forward to hanging out and partying with my friends for new years but idk they didnt want to party they wanted to play playstation which is fine I guess but idk we're in our 20s it's new years eve we always used to party but idk so basically I ended up spending it by myself and on top of that I got some weed thinking that would definetly make it better but got either the worst mid ever or some straight cbd bud idk its trash though I know that for sure, but idk for some reason after today and how it went like it just pushed to the point of that's it like I'm done with these people and I wont talk to them anymore, I'm starting all the way over and I'll try to make new friends or whatever, I deleted all my social media theres literally no way for anyone besides my family which is my grandma mom and 2 brothers to contact me. Ive just had a shitty day, but theres a backstory to it, I've always been not necessarily depressed but I usually feel kind of a mix of down and lonely extremely lonely for sure. Growing up you know like 16-20 I always had friends was always out somewhere and doing something, now I spend every single day literally the exact same, I stay at home every day in my room and lay in my bed, every day I'm not high or drunk is basically terrible but I'll have the occasional actual good feeling day but majority of the time I just feel lonely and depressed and almost like hopeless, my friends are never really trying to actually go out and do stuff anymore they always want to stay home, I used to talk to this girl and we were cool but then I dont know I went out of town for about 6 months and ever since shes just basically hated me and will probably never talk to me again, sometimes I feel really stupid because I'll be smoking or something and like just feel like I'm having a normal little conversation with her in my head not like anything weird but just like a zoned out day dream and then it sucks because I'll realize what my reality is and that shes not ever going to talk to me again and then I just feel mad at myself for even thinking like that and not just letting it go, and then I just always feel lonely and sad because nobody ever wants to go out and do shit like we used too idk, when I was out of town even after the girl didnt want to talk to anymore like yea it hurt at first for a few weeks or so but I was fine after that and had a great time and met all kinds of new people it was great i still had down and out days of course but nothing like I do at home, at home I just feel empty, and like every day seems pointless to me, I already know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next like I dont know how to explain it I just feel so empty and like depressed and I dont if hopeless is the right word but I just feel that theres no point to my day ever, every day is the same. I hate it. Every day I wish that I had a life like everyone else, everyone always has people hitting them up on snapchat and going out to eat or hanging out with friends and stuff but not me, nobody hits me up, I never go out, I never do anything. The one thing I want to do every day is get stoned or drink because it makes the way I feel go away for a little bit, Its so weird though, like if you met me in real life and didn't know I wrote this you would never guess it was me, when I was out of town I would go party at different bars and meet all kinds of new people and talk and drink and have a great time talk to girls and stuff it was fun but inside I always feel like this, I dont know tonight I'd pay anything to be in back in one those bars with all those random new people and hanging out and having a great time i felt like I was actually living but here back in my room which feels more like my prison I feel alone, sad, hopeless, and empty, but idk I'm out for the night time to go smoke some more of this trash ass weed and try to get away from this shit one more night",1

I've stopped making any effort to hang out with my friends, I've been putting off going to buy something I need because I'm afraid of interacting with people at the store, and the weirdest thing is I am now pee shy which is something I haven't struggled with before. I'm going to college next year and I'm worried that if I can't make progress getting over my social anxiety that I won't interact with anyone at my school. I passed up invitations to New Years parties and told several friends that I was out of town instead of hanging out.

This will most likely be my nonsensical ramblings connected with the thinnest thread of sanity, so if you don't want to read it or can't make sense of it, then you can just move on with your day. I understand.So life sucks. I sure hope that wasn't the most surprising fact you've heard all day. But I'm a mostly logical, agnostic person who believes that: yes, everything happens for a reason, but it's because of universal cause/effects, and not because of any greater purpose by some benevolent god. If there is a god, then the most realistic portrayal of him would be as some neutral, omnipotent comedian. I mean that in the sense that our god finds comedy in the irony and injustice of the world. And then there's the big question:âWhy do good things happen to bad people and why do bad things happen to good people?â?From all I've seen with the world thus far in my admittedly short lifetime, the only god that could feasibly exist is a mischievous trickster who revels in the cosmic irony of injustice.Yeah that was way too much of a philosophical rant. Imma slow down.So I'm a 17 year old male high school student who doesn't know a thing about life. I've just been fucked by and I'm not sure how to move on. It almost seems like my entire life up to this point has been the world's attempt to get rid of me. I felt like there was an unseen hand pushing me into pain and wanted to get rid of me. I wanted to agree with it.On September 23, I had attempted suicide due to people being assholes. Basically, over the summer I had snuck out with a girl, who I'll just refer to as Reed. Reed and I got into her car and started doing *stuff.* I'll leave it there because it doesn't need to be gone into, but the gist of it was that I'm still a virgin. Well afterwards, she told her friends about it. Now to this day I don't know what she had told them. I don't know if she was the one who called it sexual assault, or if her friends started that vocabulary (although I'm pretty sure of who it was, but I'll get into that later). But anyways, now there were rumors being spread around that I had sexually assaulted and/or raped Reed. Both of which are false, she had clearly, verbally consented multiple times, and if anything, she was very clearly being way more aggressive that I had (she's had lots of experience with this sort of thing and I'm really just kind of the archetypal introverted, shy dude).Her friends were now spreading around those false sexual assault rumors about me. Saying to people that âthey could tell anyone, but  don't tell OP.â?I lost everyone without ever knowing why. I never had a ton of friends, but I still had some close people who'd I talk to, but they avoided talking to me. Some were more overt about their hatred for me than others. One of my closest friends who I would have died for at the time (I'll be calling her Bitch) made comments about me looking like a pedophile. Now don't get me wrong, I'll be the first one to say that I'm no handsome devil, but I'd admit that I'm a decent 6.5/10. Decently tall, not that skinny, no acne, and no resting bitch face. The other comment that someone made to me I didn't understand at first, but it makes sense now. I didn't know the rumors had been spreading for two months. This happened during this time. I was walking away from lunch when a popular girl stopped me. I've known her from my classes and she's the school staple of a friendly, kind face. She stuck her hand in front of me, pointed a piece of dirty ham on the ground and said, âThat's the kind of person you are.â?I way completely taken aback. She walked away without making any sign that it had been a joke of some kind. I've thought about that moment a lot. I'd tell myself, âIf even she knew, who else heard about it, and believed it.â?So a couple months pass and I'm still not clued in by anyone about the rumors and the only thing I feel is that I'm alone. At the time, I had never felt more lonely. My closest friend (who I'll call Tom) has been ignoring me for months now. I felt us growing distant and I wanted to know know. He told me the truth. He said that he had admittedly heard these rumors about me but didn't know if he should believe them, so he just ignored me for the time. That was the first time I had heard about the rumors and I was pissed as hell. I was 100% percent convinced that Reed had started the rumors.I confronted her about it at a football game that same day and she just broke down crying when I told her. She said that she didn't mean for it to get as bad as it did and that it was her friends (which include Bitch) who had been actually spreading the rumors. I said something along the lines of âIt's been two fucking months, you shouldn't have waited this long to tell me out it.â?We argued for a while, but eventually I left at like 8pm. When I had got home, I had heard that there were two dudes that had heard the argument, were coming to beat the shit out me, and had changed my words into âYou shouldn't care if you've been assaulted, it's been two months, you should be over it.â?I never said anything along those lines. I went home and drank alcohol for the first time. It was a cheap bottle of Vanilla Crown Royal. I don't know why I drank it, it tasted like a mix of ethanol and pure vanilla extract, but it worked.The day afterward, I broke down hard. I cried for the first time in a while. I'm a guy, so society has deemed it so that I can't cry, so I usually don't. I hide my emotions to everyone, including my family, but even they asked me what was wrong. I didn't say anything to them.That night I attempted suicide because I felt that the world wanted me dead. I didn't want to be the rapist anymore, and if it worked then at least the truth would get out. People forgive anything with suicide. People can emphatically hate your guts one second, but when people bring up suicide, everyone forgives and says âoh you can talk to me.â?These people don't want you to talk to them, and they know that you won't reach out to them. But if they say that, then they can clear their mind of any guilt or shame if you kill yourself. People won't be sad if you die. Yes maybe for a little while your family will be sad, but they will move on. At the end of grief is always acceptance, you can't be sad forever. But you can be shameful and regretful forever. Regret is the only eternal emotion. If you feel regret about what you could have done, then that's the only feeling you will have for the rest of your life. Sadness, fear, pain, even love are only ephemeral and will eventually fade. On someone's death bed, when someone reflects on their own life, the most common emotion is regret, more so that sadness, fear, love, or happiness. I feel like that's the only reason people try to comfort you: the fear of regret. People will put you through hell but as long as you don't kill yourself then they can keep a clean conscience. No one can understand you because no one gives a shit about you. As long as you aren't suicidal then you're allowed to be as depressed as you want. As long as they treat the symptom of suicide then they can avoid the causes of mental illness. It's hypocritical bullshit.This is why I feel like I can't talk to anyone about anything. I'm feeling suicidal right now, but I don't even feel like I can turn to my family or friends. How are they supposed to understand what it's like going through several knives trying to find the one that cuts best? I know that the hair on my arm made it feel like cutting through a gritty, leathery sandpaper and I can't think of anything else besides that. Ironically I feel like the only person who understands me is Reed (as she's a victim in this situation too) but talking to her just feels wrong, like the invisible guiding hand is telling me to get away from her. .......I'm mostly done with this but I'll add a few more notes at the end- Reed, Bitch and her friend are all either bisexual or lesbian, and I believe that they created the rumors to push me away from her - Bitch and Reed were in an abusive relationship before (Bitch being the abuser)- Bitch directly lied, saying to Reed that she had told no one about the rumors, despite text screenshots that Tom had sent me showing Bitch telling Tom the rumorsTLDR: False sexual assault claims, suicide attempt, too many words, none of this is important",1

603,"Fuck this. : I'm using Siri to write this because I just don't have the energy to write it myself. Everyone hates this holiday I'm not unique in thinking that. And actually I was having a pretty good New Year's. But it up at 11:30 the bar my friends chose to go to treated me like shit so I left and disgust. I texted them what happened and called them, and made plans to meet them at a different bar. After purchasing about $40 worth of alcohol (new year's prices) I told them that I had a table at a bar just across the street from where they were literally across the street and three businesses down. They said OK and that they would be there as soon as person x got back from the restroom. 30 minutes went by including midnight. They were nowhere to be found and I was left alone as in possibly alone as you can imagine. Outside and what Hass to be about 25Â° weather. With $40 of booze sitting in front of me. No one I know, no one I care about, no one that cares about me. Finally I get a text that says they wound up at the bar across the street from where I was, (most bars are in the same general vicinity). My story is a bit quickened. Actually they had told me they were at that bar with about 10 minutes to midnight. I had asked them if they could please hurry over across the street to where I was because I had not only spent so much money on the spot but I was also extraordinarily alone. They said sure, and nothing happened. I sat there for probably a total of 40 minutes feeling like an idiot. Sitting there thinking that I had friends that gave a shit about me, when they really didn't at all. I know it's just a stupid tradition of the clock passing midnight, but I don't know that I've ever felt so alone in my life, knowing that the people I choose to spend the night with, The people I consider to be very very good friends, my closest. We're perfectly fine just living it up at a different bar and letting me sit alone. Eventually I worked up the nerve to finish one of the drinks I wanted to, and go over to find them. There was clearly no intention of leaving there anytime soon, they were perfectly comfy in a booth laughing away. After about 10 minutes of sitting there with absolutely zero interaction with any of them, they decided to go to a different bar. This one with the cover. I told them there was no way I would spend money at a place that I really don't like, rather another place I really don't like, I despise the first one we were at. I told my friend (my closest), I'd see him later. And walked home. Along the way I texted him that I don't know if I've ever felt this much like killing myself, and that I didn't wanna spend the rest of the shitty night and a place I hate and especially I didn't want to spend money to do so. So far, no response even though I can see that he has read it. Fuck today fuck this holiday fuck the meaning we put behind it and fuck all the people I thought cared about me. Just so you're aware I have a history with severe depression and anxiety, this isn't out of nowhere, although it is my first time posting about it so there is probably a lot of missing nuance and backstory. I'll probably believe this at some point, but right now I truly just hate myself and everyone around me. Truly the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last few months has been my semi new puppy. I really think that if I had assurances that she would have a happy life without me, I do it tomorrow.",1
604,"Cried my way into 2020 : I was talking to my friend and I said how I was left alone for new years and said how i hated it and was upset/depressed. I told him i had cried earlier and was upset that i was so lonely, but i put a clown emoji and a peace sign with it to not have it be that serious, cuz I'm a train wreck and had to make it lighthearted somehow. He replied with ""you can go snapchat *[insert my ex's name here]*"" in a serious tone and I started crying then got mad since I blatantly told him i was sad/depressed and in his head that response was the best fucking thing for him to add a ""lighthearted mood"" to the conversation. Then he acts like he's the victim because he was insanely insensitive.So i'm starting the new year at rock bottom, and it can either go up (probably not), stay the same (most likely), or I'll die and be done with it (least likely cuz I'm a wimp).",1

Just a reminder of the decay that has been going on inside of me for a long time, and for some reason, I'm still here. I don't feel like I should be here.

I'm not gonna attend a prestigious uni like my brothers and I don't have straight A's like them either I feel pathetic and I'm not sure if I like what I'm studying anymore;Nursing. I lost a lot of friends n I don't hang out with anyone anymore. My girlfriend is kinda of a dick but I stick around because she's my only source of happiness when she's nice to me. Idk what I should even do anymore :/ thoughts and opinions? Maybe I'm just going through it rn because I don't always feel like this but I've noticed I've been feeling this way a bit more often.,1
618,"I hate this month : I hate January. With a passion. I've been in bed every available minute since Christmas, dreading it. It's stupid to dwell, and I know it, but I can't stop.I lost my grandmother, who practically raised me and was my mother as a child, in January. She was the glue that held my family together. We lost her, and we fell apart. My mom and uncle both divorced their respective partners, there were unrepairable rifts caused, and members moved hours away. I haven't seen or spoken to my uncle in a decade. I barely see my cousins, who were basically my sisters growing up. I got so mad at my grandfather, the biggest father figure I had, over revelations made after her death that I didn't speak to him for years. We've since reconnected, but it's not like it was. My mom and I have grown a lot closer in the wake, but I've lost the nearness of everyone else. I nearly died in January. My ex-husband was abusive, and we fought... He strangled me with a power cord until I blacked out not even 5 feet away from our sleeping 6 month old. He was arrested. The court system basically told me that my life wasn't worth shit. He was out of jail in 4 days on ""time served."" He moved in with his 8 month pregnant girlfriend and turned off my electricity. He broke into my apartment on numerous occasions, despite my protective order. I tried to have something done about it, and his command threatened harm to me and to my career. I went to my own command and was beaten down verbally - they not only threatened my career, but did everything they could to me that couldn't be traced back to that incident. I had to look over my shoulder for months because there were people quite literally out to get me, waiting for the smallest slip up so they could Captain's Mast me. I ended up having a nervous breakdown in a doctor's office, and he quite possibly saved my life by helping me get discharged from the military. Two years ago today, a friend I grew up with, my best friend's little brother who became my other best friend and my very first love, killed himself. His wife alienated him from every one of his friends, got pissed and screamed at him and me when we tried to catch up via text a few years ago - years after they had gotten married and we had both moved on with life. So when he posted on Facebook basically begging for someone to talk to two years and two days ago, I ignored it. I didn't want to be responsible for bringing more shit to his life when she got pissed again. Apparently, they were having issues (again) and she had threatened to leave him and take his kids. She was packing bags. He took his life. It's hard to know how to feel. I've been struggling with it for years now. We hadn't seen each other in a decade. Hadn't spoken in years because the wife was very possessive and jealous. I kept my distance. But, he was a HUGE part of my childhood. We were dating off and on for probably the better part of 6 years. He was my first love, and I still cared about him and his family. They were my family too - I still talk to them. His sister is still a friend, though we grew apart thanks to geography and crappy husbands. I saw his mom a couple days ago, she hugged me, said she missed me, told me to come over soon. I live two blocks away, but I can't bring myself to go to that house. I feel like I have more sorrow and grief over him being gone than I'm entitled to. It makes it worse because I feel guilty for it. I don't know how much I'm allowed to feel, so I don't show much of anything and I've spent two years on the edge of boiling over from holding it in. I really fucking miss just knowing he was out there somewhere, with his goofy grin and his laughing eyes. He was always so happy, always laughing and smiling. I can't reconcile that with someone in a place so dark. And I guess that's part of my grief, too. Knowing that the world took that spark of life away from him and crushed him so thoroughly. It absolutely breaks my heart. But worst of all about January ... I was born and with every passing year, I'm reminded how little I've achieved with my life thus far. I'll be 33, I just finally got financially stable. And all I can think about is how miserable I am. I stayed up while the kids did for the new year hype, but I can't sleep now. My mom's dog is sleeping over here tonight. He's snuggly, where my dog isn't at all. So, he's asleep with his head on my stomach and I'm laying here with tears rolling down my face, trying not to disturb him. But I needed to get this out somewhere. It's probably an incoherent mess, but I feel a little lighter. But seriously... I really fucking hate January.",1
619,"Idk, I don't think living is worth it anymore. : I've been fighting for 28 years and I think I'm done with living. Idk I should have died a long time ago but I ended up being adopted. I wish I wasn't. Too bad I'm high functioning too. Have a good job, exercise daily, have a good community, great friends and hobbies. People don't think I'm depressed. I guess I really don't have a reason. Just verifies the fact that I'm piece of shit. But all I want is to die. I want the constant nagging to stop. Why am I still alive?

621,"2020 is the year I take a stand against depression. : Depression is a greedy soab. It takes far too much time, far too many lives. It ruins relationships with families, spouses, friends... It ruins the mind of those it afflicts. Treatment is a long process, with so many wrong roads to go down. I have tried pills; many kinds. I have tried therapy many times. The depression I have is something I can't fix with these things, I have learnt this. It took over 10 years to figure it out but better late than never. And while there may be no true end to it, I've found the best way to get over feeling depressed (in my case) is to actively rebel against it. ""I don't want to cook dinner, I'll just have toast.""   ""I can't go for a walk, it's too cold.""   ""I don't feel like doing anything."" etc etc... You know the drill I'm sure.But you know what, depression? Fuck you. I may not be motivated to do anything at all right now but out of sheer spite, as a complete middle finger to this horrible mental affliction... I'm going to prove you wrong. You do not own me.",1

I feel like no one cares. My best friend was my girlfriend and we broke up just before Christmas so i don't even know who to talk to anymore. Not to mention she's already out with other guys. I'm just lost. I have no true friends. It's just a mirage. I go to my classes and do my work, but that's about it. I have no one to share my feelings with so I get lost in my mind like I had always used to. I don't know what to expect posting this, I just needed to vent.",1

630,"Happy new year : Never posted in here before, 2019 was quite a year of loneliness. Turned 21 spent my birthday alone all day, 3 failed relationships, One of my best friends found a girlfriend which I couldn't be happier for he deserves it however, it has led to him disappearing from my life as well as his other friends, Ive also lost a few contracts on jobs. 2018/2019 wasn't my best years and 2019 was by far the lowest. Never been one to be invited to parties as much as I socialize and try to make more friends. but a friend invited me to one last minute tonight. So I showed up but only familiar faces of a class that graduated before me and who had no idea who I was so I looked for my friend and he was on the side of the house throwing up. Grabbed him some waters and a few napkins and left. Spent 40 minutes driving around by my self listening to music.Here's to 2020. More lonely nights. More ignored texts. More rejections.

While I appreciate it of course, when I got back home I just lost it.. like I never have before, I guess it was just the finality of new years coming to pass and the only person who gave a shit about me, who even had some genuine care about me was the guy at the pizza place.

I have to stay up all night just to be able to sleep the next. It's not just my body. It's my mind as well. My mind just races, and even when it isn't racing, it's just this gentle but painful ""hum"" that is horribly consistent.I slept last night...finally. I realized why my mind might be fighting it as well. When I wake up..? I am horrible. I'm waking up to a reality that I refuse to believe in. I wake up to find that all of my ambition (which I had to fight so hard the previous day to obtain) is now gone... I wake up ready to bite anybody's head off, and I have. I've had people text me to ask if I'm alright, and I've said ""Fuck you, fuck off,"" and then proceed to lie to them about whatever they ask before putting my phone down for the day and ignoring all the beeps. Now that I type that last word, I'm realizing that I should just put it on silent, or have it off altogether.

This is becoming harder.Anyway, all I came here to vent about was the fact that I really wish I could sleep. I'm going to lay down in a bit.

Everytime I try to have a serious conversation with them about what is going on they blow me off and yell at me for trying to get attention.They make me move schools about every 5-6 months or so which makes it really hard to make friends. Currently they are home schooling me which means I sit at the kitchen table in full view of everyone looking at a computer all day for about 10 hours. I cannot go outside and all social activities are banned I guess you would say. Everything in my house is under lockdown. For Christ sake they have locks on the fridge and cabinets. I have to ask for everything and most times the answer isn't just a no, it turns into a whole ass lecture.Going into this new year I cannot think of anything good that's going for me and I genuinely feel like trash. I got a really bad 'wave'  of pure helplessness and started to cut myself, I stopped myself before it got too bad but my arm is currently fucked up again. I dont know what I'm doing with my life and I sure don't know what I'm doing here. I guess I'm just hoping I'm not the only one going through this.Fuck New year's. It's just a holiday that makes you realise what a fucking shitty year you had and now you have to do it all over again.",1

Maybe the only thing that gives my life meaning is my constant war with myself. I don't know who I would be if I won.",1

I went out last night for NYE with some friends, only one of them I consider close and see often. We went to a small festival thing, it was okay, the music was nice, the atmosphere was trashy. I left after midnight and decided to walk home for some time to myself.The next morning I didn't have a hangover from drinking, it felt like i had an emotional hangover. I felt utterly horrible, so incredibly alone and distant from everything, and that I was such an embarrassment last night, what is the point of even trying to be social or likeable or whatever.  It feels like this happens so often, even if I can muster the energy to enjoy a night out, the next day makes me feel like it's not even worth trying to feel happy, because the aftermath is such a deep low.",1

Getting advice from a therapist is good, but having to ask for help because it's gotten too far might make others feel useless without other people and I'm really confused because I don't know what's best for anything anymore.

670,Hello 2020 : 2020 just started and im depressedcan anyone relate,1
671,Waiting for it to just end. : I was diagnosed 2 years ago with an illness that quite frankly isn't that bad in some but horrible in others and I got the shit end of that stick. I was trying to pull my life together everything was looking better I wasn't as depressed as I use to be and then everything went to shit. I honestly wanted to die the second I found out because I knew it was going to make getting my life together harder. But I didn't realise it was going to in a sense end it. But I kept trying because even as screwed as I thought I was I didn't really know how bad it was going to get and I saw my family really cared for me and I didn't want to hurt them so I fought.I went from being physically in the best shape of my life to being unable to walk to my bathroom on somedays without feeling drained. I'm in horrible pain everyday I went from never smoking anything to smoking weed almost daily as to bring down the pain a bit. My mind has been destroyed not by the weed but by the drugs that were used earlier in my illness when I was on them I went from being able to do calculus to having issues adding. My memory went to shit and even almost a year and a half later I'm not even half of what I use to be mentally.8 or 9 months ago I was told by my doctor that this disease is going to kill me and they no longer want to give me medication for it as it has done little to help me. I hope every single time I go to sleep I won't wake up. Everytime I allow myself to think I just imagine what I could have nothing amazing but something. I catch myself occasionally forgetting I can't do those things I want to do. Nights when I can't sleep from the pain I just wish for this to end. I've been to therapy got sent to psychiatric hospital after my 3rd surgery because I can't take this. The hospital made things much worse mentally. I've told people that my doctor says that I will die to this illness and surviving this long makes me feel like a liar. I don't know when this will kill me but my doctor said he'd be surprised if I had 5 years that is far to long. I'm not angry at the world I'm not upset I'm just done. I just want to sleep and never wake up I'm not alive I'm just existing at this point. I go through the motions of day to day life I don't seem depressed on the outside I make the same jokes about it like I use to as a way to show my friends I'm fine but honestly I'm not.,1

Letting those guys go has been difficult, and in a rather contradictory manner - my heart tells me I was right but also wrong due to increased amount of solitude I now face. I never realized it would be this difficult living with yourself.

Not like âfuck youâ?mean but her way of just being sarcastic with all my genuine questions like âare you okayâ?or âim sorry If i said/did anythign wrongâ? Often when she's not okay when we're face to face she doesn't tell me what's going on but I know something is wrong. Then she gets home and we're texting. The second paragraph happens, then she starts saying how she doubts me and stuff like that. When she's having really bad episodes during the night, I would pick her up from her house because again (she might cut or run away) and we would sleep in the car together. Sometimes when I take her back to her house, she would not go in, she would just sit in front of her house and I would have to literally beg her to go in. I have to deal with this every single day and everything I do is to make sure she's okay and it's REALLY taking a toll on my mental health. Its come to a point where I don't even have a life anymore.

I told him how I never organise anything for my birthday because my friends all let me down, and that it is actually a really depressing time for me. I have gained such a complex over the years with my birthday. My friends and family very rarely celebrate it with me, and when they do, its over during NYE celebrations, or ends up being an extremely mild affair. I see so many people throughout the year get completely spoiled on their birthdays. While I have got used to this disappointment, I was looking forward to this year, as my Boyfriend is a very thoughtful person, so I thought he would pull out all the stops. Turns out he didnt. His birthday was in November, and I took us on holiday for it. However, when I asked him yesterday if he planned anything, he hadn't. So I booked the restaurant. He has kids from a previous marriage, and I then realised that he has the kids that weekend. He said he would rearrange it, which he did, but I'm gutted, and heart broken tbh. I put so much thought into his birthday, yet he couldnt be bothered to organise anything for mine, or even confirming whether he had his kids that weekend or not. Its sorted, we're going to a nice restaurant sat night for my birthday, but I feel so let down that he was so thoughtless. Any suggestions on how I should move forward, in terms of how I should deal with this with my BF (btw, we have already had a huge argument about it, where he claimed i said i didnt want to do anything, which was not the case, but I'm struggling to move on). But more importantly, in terms of what I should do about taking ownership of this.

A few of our senior workers didn't like the change so I've stepped up (by my own choice, my bosses are actually fantastic and would never ask) and worked longer hours and weekends to keep everything going. I'm up for a huge promotion next year because of it.Towards the end of the year I noticed I was getting more tired and snappy so I booked a long break over Christmas where we'd normally shut down, assuming it was exhaustion. Now I'm off I feel like it's gotten worse. Spending time with people annoys me, I don't find joy in anything I do. I literally sleep and watch videos all day. I haven't left the house or showered for a week because I haven't needed to. I assume that everyone hates me because I am so dull.I thought the break would refresh me but I was just using work to cover up what I assume to be a deep depression. Looking back the reason I put so many hours in is because I didn't want to have to deal with my life at all, I wanted excuses to not socialise.I feel like a shell of a human, more robotic than anything else. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I don't know what I'm going to do.

I have become a lot quieter and I no longer enjoy things i previously did ( I no longer enjoy anything to be honest). I had managed to fake happiness in the past but now I am really struggling. I kept getting questions as to why I am so numb to everything.  I lied saying I had flu the week before and not feeling 100%.I needed suggestions whether or not I should confess to my family and friends? The reasons i didn't do it till now are :1)Mental health awareness is very poor in my country. My family would likely think I am faking it or everybody feels low sometimes2)Afraid of being judged by the very few friends I have left. I am also afraid they might leave me eventually 3) I really don't want people to pity meAny advice is appreciated.",1

Oh forgot to mention. I have biological brother and sister. Brother fucked off and did the typical male life and so did my sister.Dont have really need to go down that unsupported family story. Just family members focuse on their own lonely lives.Truth, I have been involved around death himself all my life 3yo mother die4yo father committed From 5-15 family pets16 lost a friend  (he die as a hero)17 on,  to many letters of funeral letters drove my grandmother in a self counting state.I lost her back in September.I can bring in the idols I looked up to and strove to be Strong for my family (while being the baby of the family) have the right things to say (even when theres nothing for me to say)So ya truth, I myself is a ticking time bomb.If anyone of my age or older should know what I'm going next.I have a substant abuse issue, (weed and alcohol nothing harder) you may think ""that's fine, so do I""And that's where you're wrong I can function while under the influence of in my system.

Or ""just fell like falling into a pit""Hear is the truth, its stem from what you say vs what you truly want to say. And last night . . . Well the truth slipped and again I'm alone. I hopped on tell you my story but in reality I'm using this as a confessional, and honestly if you read done this far. I wish I can tell you life has some fun moments. But that reality is bought with someone going threw out their lives and going threw hell.It's sad I cant even us my own money cuz I have to use it to eat. I may not look it but being a 6foot guy below 200lb I look like a thinner soldier but remove my clothes, you would think I'm anorexic or have a fast thyroid.So just imagine an toothpick walking.Now that I dont have anyone why should I pull this 15lb trigger?",1

705,"Forever Lost : (22F) I've had severe depression since I was 14 and going into 2020 I've just been hit with a massive wave of overwhelming dread. I quit my perfectly âgoodâ?job of 3.5 years before Christmas because I hated it (I just hate work in general, always have, that's for a separate post) but I felt stuck in a massive rut, I knew I wasn't doing myself any favours by staying and when I decided to resign it's like my depression vanished, for a couple weeks I felt so excited and optimistic about the future. I had no job lined up and I planned to âfigure it outâ?while going back home for the holidays.But now I'm just, lost. I've been lost since I was 14 and I don't know how to escape this feeling of not belonging in this world. I've never felt like I've belonged here, like this life isn't for me. I can't fathom the amount of fucking suffering we go through just to live a ânormalâ?life. I remember as a teen becoming aware of the fuckery that is this world and feeling such a massive void inside of me. I used to cry myself to sleep every night and look at the stars and try and make sense of what was happening to me.Now I'm so empty I can barely cry at all. Nothing feels good, even the good times. I don't feel a passion or drive to do anything. In some ways I've grown up since then and done well, but on the inside I'm the same messed up teenager I was and even though it was 8 years ago it still feels like yesterday. I have no sense of direction, trying to look at jobs to apply to makes me so overwhelmed and suicidal. No traditional career path interests me. Art and music used to be my hobbies/passion. Those things used to bring me such joy, but now it's just... âehâ? I don't have the patience or the focus. I feel like my brain has been deteriorating over these past years and sometimes I struggle to make sentences or remember simple things. It really scares me because dementia and Alzheimer's run in both sides of my family and I already feel like I'm losing my ability to function. I have not been able to think clearly or think at all for the longest time now, it's like extreme brain fog that I don't know how to get rid of.Anyways sorry for the long post, I just need to let it out somewhere.I've never posted before but this subreddit makes me feel some sort of comfort that I'm not alone in this.

706,I really. Really need help. I feel like my life is over. I have no one. I lost everything. : Hi there. This post will be fairly short because i prefer talking about my problems in dms. But uhh. Ill just say whats happening.IVE been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a year and a half.She saved me from an abusive relationship. And she Was the best thing in my life. But she was a very broken and unstable person.She.. Lied. About being raped.  She made fake accounts to harass herself. She made fake accounts to accuse me and herself of cheating on eachother. She has anger issues. And an abusive family.I helped her as much as i could. And she did too. I saved her from her abusive family and helped make her life better.Weve been having relationship problems because after she confessed to her lies. She became increasingly abusive and harsh.  And.. A few days ago she cheated. On me.  It was on the same day that she insulted me and called me worthless and stuffI dont know what to do.. I really dont. I fucking love her so much. I love her more than any thing and.. I forgave everything. My past girlfriend cheated on me 3 times and boasted about it and rubbed it in my face. I let my current know this. I let her know that any thing is okay. But cheating is the one thing i can not deal with. And now when it happened ive been so.. Broken.I dont think she hates me. She has anger issues. She suffers from bullying. Abusive parenting. And lots of sexual assault.Shes fucked up. Shes the most innocent. Pure person. But also the most sexual and slutty person. I dont know what to do.. Ive been crying so Much and i have no one to talk to. My best friend thats been the only person supporting kind of.. Got tired of me and told me to fuck off. I feel so suicidal and broken. I cant really talk to anyone in reallife due to my country.I havent mentioned many things. So please dont make an opinion of me or her before asking me things. If youre willing to help me send me a message and  ill respond as fast as i canAlso somethjng important to mention is that we have really. Really good synergy. Physically we  are perfect for eachother. Sexually too. And our humor. Music taste. Beliefs. Religion. Everything is ideal.,1

708,"One night stand at new year's eve party : Okay, so this was my first party at the ripe old age of 15. I only knew two people at the party, one of which left cause they got bored and the other one knew most of them. I arrive, thank the host, bla bla. First hour or two im just chilling with the guy who was gonna leave. I get a beer, and drink most of it (my friend left after) and socially im doing better than i thought i would. Im having ""fun"". Few shots later still having fun. I had seemed to have hit it off with a girl who was single (spoiler shes the one night). Midnight comes and i drink like 3-4 glasses of champagne. I lie down --&gt; im drunk. After i get drunk i get loudish/talkative and just generally say whatever comes to my mind, including secrets/insecurities/depression. So my friend and the girl babysit me cause i cant walk in a straight line. And i start ranting on and on about my problems (mom's cancer, depression, choking myself, etc.). I think i cuddled the girl, but she stopped cause she wanted me to be sober while doing stuff. After that she took me on a walk so i could get fresh air. After which i started to hug her (vigorously) in front of my friend. Since this was also a sleepover me and her slept in the guest room. By this time i was kinda sober. I started to cuddle her which lead to making out and groping, but she stopped from going further cause again i was still kinda drunk and she just met me. The rest of the night we just cuddled. After we woke up she went to her friends. I was sober by this point which meant i went from confident social guy to depressed anti social guy. We talked a bit about why i was being antisocial, cuddled a bit more, i got her number and hugged for a really long time before i left.After which i felt like shit not from the booze but just from the emptiness. I want to meet her again, but im scared that she'll get bored of the real me, the antisocial depressed me. She knew the drunk me, not the real one. Im also scared i'll hurt her physically or verbally, due to my depression and my previous relationship where i hurt the other person by ignoring her asking me out for over a year, even though she knew i knew. Tl;DR: Went to a party,  tipsy --&gt; fun, drunk --&gt; told all my secrets/insecurities to a girl. Made out/cuddled with her the whole night. Woke up --&gt; got depressed/antisocial/sober. Scared of contacting her cause of past trauma and insecurities.Question: How do I go about contacting her, mind you I'm extremly awkward.

712,"Looking back at the last decade and my depression : Hey guys, For the first time i finally wrote down my depression in words in hopes I can learn and move on from it. I want to start 2020 feeling better and I hope some else can relate. 1st jan 2020 I hate writing these kinds of things but im giving it a go anyway to see if I feel any different afterIve never been more depressed in my life. Last year It feels like I had more depressed days than normal days. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want this to be a better year but I don't know how I can achieve that at this point. I've contemplated suicide (almost regularly) and even running away either which wont resolve my problems. Only I can, and that feels like an incredibly daunting task. I can't do this alone. Therapists are expensive. I smoke weed on a nightly basis to get away from this temporarily, but in the end it still makes me feel even more depressed. Especially the following day, it feels like these depressive thoughts are trapped inside with me. I should stop and take a break from smoking, but at the same time I enjoy smoking and the feeling you get while high. Im in some pretty substantial cognitive dissonance over this. I know this is not a great option to tackle it, but it certainly beats getting addicted to alcohol to escape my problems. I do exercise fairly regularly as well. The following three are what I want most in life, and these things I think will give me that happiness I long for. Now I know  some aspects of this are unrealistic and likely wont happen anytime soon but its these things that are always on my mind. I want to achieve them one way or another. GirlfriendI've been single my whole life, never had an irl girlfriend and these days ive never felt lonelier than ever. I just want someone to come home to that loves me, to get a hug and be told everything will be ok. I just want someone I can be happy with, make new memories, and just start life afresh with basically. I just don't want to feel alone any longer, I want to experience actual love and affection for the first time, and to reciprocate that. I crave this more than anything In life. Am so introverted, I have few IRL friends which most are guys. I have only ever had guy friends. I can talk to girls (I think) but I never know how to initiate anything other than small talk. They just never seem to be interested, and I don't know why. In my friend groups, and in my work team I am the only single person and I feel left out whenever talks about SO's come up. I feel like I am a bit of a social guy. I do go out for nights out occasionally and go to gigs regularly. And mosf of the time if I get invited to someones birthday party or a night out I will usually go. I do meet new people during these occasions and again when it comes to talking to girls it seems like that goes nowhere either., even if its just friends. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. My family are stupidly religious with a very very old school mentality. They genuinely believe and live their life by their religion in very old school traditional ways. They want me to get an arranged marriage and have hinted this over the last couple of years. Now this is a quick fix for this whole girlfriend problem, but fuck that. I could never ever marry someone like them, especially if I don't know them. It'll never work and it doesn't, not at this side of the planet. My sister and my second oldest brother got married this away and they're not happy with their lives and marriage. They're miserable because my brother and sister are just simply incompatible with their SO's. I remember them barely having much time to get to know each other. And the fact that both have kids makes life even more difficult for them. I don't want this.  The only person who is truly happy in this family is my oldest brother who lives in another country with his wife he knew and dated for years before getting married 13 years ago and are still very happy together. I wish I could have this. She is from a different culture altogether and her family practice a different religion. My dad hated this and it took him years before he allowed his wife to come into our house. I remember when I turned 16 my dad sat me down on my birthday and told me that I can never have a girlfriend. I still think about this and it bothers me. I really want to prove him wrong.  I wish one day I can bring a girl home and explain that I don't want the life he wants me to have, I want to show him that I want to be with that person and not with someone who he decides for an arranged marriage. This will be a very difficult day when it comes but is necessary. He needs a reality check. My own apartmentI still live at home with my dad, step-mother, older brother, his wife and their two kids. It's too much sometimes. I can't go and pursue the things I want In life whilst stuck here. I have been wanting to move out all year but that's not an easy task either. Either I save for many years to put down a deposit and then get a mortgage which is the best method, but I don't know how long this will take and Im already desperate to get out of this house. The other option would be to rent, which is something I can do in the next few months but will have no support from my family if I do this. I'd rather do this as it means I can get away now of course and I have seen some really nice furnished flats going for great prices that Im certain I can afford. I'm in two minds. Every time I mention this to my dad he makes it sound like a terrible thing to do and ultimately makes me feel worse for these ideas. He wants me to get an arranged marriage first before moving out. FUCK THAT. My brothers have my support here which is good. BandMusic is what I live for. I love music, I love listening, watching, playing and generally being around music. I genuinely think if I didn't have this there would be no point for me being alive. My whole life over the last 10 years has evolved around it.  I've always wanted to play in a band, I have in the past and im desperate to get back into the scene again. I just want to be around similar minded people that I can jam with and ultimately be on stage having a great time playing good music with. The feeling of being on stage infront of an audience who are also having a great time Is on another level. A lot of the time when listening to music or watching a band live I imagine myself being in their position. This is another thing I think I will always pursue so I'm not giving up hope in this sense. I need to get the apartment situation sorted first before I can join a band. Again, my family have a problem with this. They think it's a waste of time and believe I should spend that time on religion instead, like them. I had to quit my last band right before we had gigs lined up and had studio time booked so we can record out first album simply because of my family. My dad demanded I stop and sell all of my guitars and equipment. That day was the worst day of my life, to have something I so dearly love just taken away like that, and I have still not recovered from it. This was in Aug 2016 and im certain this kicked off the depression. They think its embarrassing me going out to band practices and gigs carrying my equipment. They think it makes them look bad to their friends and family who are also just as crazy, delusional religious like them because their kids don't do these kinds of things. It's this mentality that also affects the whole girlfriend thing. I still play regularly on my own and still buy and sell instruments. I always have to figure out how to sneak them in and out the house which is always very stressful otherwise they kick up a massive fuss If they catch me. And I always walk away very annoyed and back depressed. One time I saved up for a guitar I really wanted for a long time, it wasn't cheap and when I took it home I put it in the garage to hide before picking it later that night when everyone was asleep. When I went back its was simply gone! You cannot lose a guitar inside a hardcase easily. The garage was locked as well. When I confronted my parents they did not own up and never did. I know 100% they did it, my dad denied it and step mother denied it even more. I still have never seen that guitar since. This still bothers and scares me, it's not the first time they've done something like this. They've never given me a proper reason why they're so against music. I one time got an answer out my dad but it was bullshit. He didn't want me getting addicted to drugs and getting into music even more so I can continue doing drugs. WTF????? -----------------------------------------------------------------------After writing this it is now more clear that there is a root source of this and that is my family and their bullshit backwards and religious ways. I know moving out is the best way to get away so that I can then finally have those things I want without them holding me back and telling me no. It's a long and difficult journey and ive never wanted anything more in my life. Ive never made a new years resolution and this will be my first for 2020 and to apply for the rest of the decade. I will get there one way or another.",1

I usually don't let the negativity get to me, but now I just feel so fricken worthless. I can't do anything. Not even interact with people like I used to. I lost practically everyone I used to know, and they moved on. Everyone does eventually. I don't know if I'm depressed but, I feel like my worth is zero to none at this point. I told myself for the longest time, 2020 is gonna be my year, my strongest year yet, I'm a day in and I already feel like giving up. Pathetic right.",1

I feel like it's just a matter of time before everything in my life falls apart. I'm an okay student, maybe even above average. There are like 2 or 3 people who have better grades than me.

730,"My brother passed on Monday morning : Hello, I'm writing this because I don't know how to cope with this and I don't know what to do. My brother was a year older than me. We are half brothers. He was fighting with addiction all of 2018. He got clean with the help of our mom and enlisted in the military to try and change his life. He succeeded. He graduated basic and was stationed in Georgia. He was so excited to start traveling the world. He came back last week to our home town to see me, his girlfriend, his son, and our grandma. Well when he was in town he wanted to try it again. He wanted to feel the high as he hasn't in so long. So he got some Fentanyl pills. He overdosed before Christmas and got rushed to a hospital with his girlfriend. He was saved with Narcan. He told me he took too many OxyContin and thats what caused it. If only I wasn't so blind. He then overdosed again this last Saturday. I didn't know about this, but he was revived again. On Sunday he wanted to spend some time with his son, so he stayed at my grandmas house with him. We were supposed to go to the local zoo on Monday.. made plans to spend New Years together before he headed back to Georgia. My brother overdosed again on Sunday. We weren't there to save him this time. Monday morning his son found my brother, his father, slumped and bleeding. My brother was gone. We are planning the funeral now, but it doesn't feel real to me. I rushed over to my grandmas to see him. I had to see him. Even with that image in my head, I can't believe it. I don't know how to process this. I cried when everyone celebrated the new year. This was supposed to be his year. He was just supposed to visit. I don't know what to do. One of my questions is, did he die in piece? Did he feel any pain? I feel like if I knew the answer I could breathe a moment. I want to know what he felt. If he was in pain while going, I know I'll be a wreck. I know he did not intend to overdose, but it happened and it's left his family broken. If anyone can help me, please.",1

At the beginning of the year my engagement broke off and subsequent events compounded on it.I had started to bounce back by finding a creative outlet in writing and was so excited to make 2020 my year. Then my dad got sick. He's older and has had compilations but when I saw him on Christmas it was like he didn't even know I was there. He couldn't speak or walk on his own, I had saw him the week before and he was fully functional. It really threw me off.Then I heard he was admitted to the hospital. He had a seizure and possibly a stroke. They had found traces of bleeding in his brain and... I'm trying to be optimistic but something inside me is absolutely lurching with dredd. I can't get my mind off it. I keep getting so anxious out of nowhere. I'll space out and find myself staring at the wall an hour later. Today is the second day I've called of work in a row. My managers seem understanding and kind but there's only so much sympathy an employer can afford to give. But I just can't bring myself to go there. It's not even a hard job, I like my job.I'm normally so emotionally shut off from big events that should affect me. To the point where I sometimes feel like a monster because I can feel the emotions that I know I should. This year though has been so taxing and everything is in overdrive.

But you see, today's January 1st and I feel the need to say all of this, why?! Well because the last couple of years were so bad that they were the worst of my life, in 2017 I was diagnosed with anxiety and last year, 2019, I found out I had depression. I learned what was loosing someone I loved and cared, I thought I was going to die, but thankfully I was strong enough to ask for help and out an end to this bullshit. I was tired of being unhappy, I was tired of every single day thinking that I had a new kind of terminal desease, I was tired of being that version of me!! I had to do something about it...And so I did, this is my last month of treatment, I'm nervous, but I'm happy. I felt like 2019 was a prison and a constantly reminder of the shit I had been through. Thank God, 2020 is finally here, and that means 2019 belongs in the past, in a chapter of my life that I left behind, and it's never ever coming back. I'll no longer be that girl, that tries to please others and forgets about her own happiness, that girl that thinks she doesn't deserve the good things in life, that girl who thinks she was dumb and an idiot, who thought she was too much fat, had too much boobs, eated too much, laughed too loud, socialized too less... but you know what?! She's a woman now, she's an adult and she has realized that she's beatiful, and smart, and fun, and caring, and loving and if she fights for what she wants she deserves everything good that comes into her life. Fuck what everyone thinks, fuck what the old her thought.She found herself, her real self, and even though not every day is a good day, she knows that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, or the next day, will be better!! She is loved and loves herself...I hope everyone that suffers from depression can find the light in the end of the tunnel as I did.

756,"Christmas Noose : Impending like a noose reliant upon the slightest pinch of gravity, Christmas came, descending the world and everything in it to the brink of the obsolete. I had just come home from being abroad for 16 months; a trip one would hope and expect to be tickled pink with engaging stories and comedy, wisdom and knowledge to be shared. but i was depleted, and the expectation of this hearty social spiel put me off ease. I had come to witness and suffer a lot about myself in the past months, a personal revelation of sorts.and it's nothing new this sort of thing, but this time my self inflicting alienation was pushed to the brink of possibly no return.Now factor in relationships of mixed dynamics, uncertain and weary groundings and my vulnerability to inevitable triggers, you have my worst major depression of my adult years.Family burst through the doors as joy flooded the halls alike the day Christ walked the earth. All sin and past troubles forgiven, personal strife and habitual feuds overcome. Tensions in themselves silenced while penance was dealt and checked; for this one last Hurrah of the year, together we'll ring in the bells. The house was falling down with good vibes, positive feeling caressed past failures of what Christmas stood for any year before. It was going to be a merry Christmas for everyone, no doubt about it. Barr the one unsettled trembling in the shadow of its wake.23rd, my brothers birthday; it was the only time I felt the fear of a real attempt. Any time previously was mere ideation or desire, the epitome of justified wallowing where i could alas drift off to sleep. I left a birthday card on my brothers bed while everyone was out; making errands, seeing friends, soaking up the immanent joys of the Christmas spirit. I was at home checking online the Hangmans knot. My wardrobe called to me sinisterly as it was just the two of us alone, it took the form of regrettable reminiscence that all these years before it stood there towering, i was oblivious to its fate. all at once so obvious but startling that thats where it will end. standing inside of it was as if it was made for me. It's size and stability; another dimension. In a way alike luxury, to go out like this. but all at once so painful that the odds were exact, it was clear more than ever i needed to get out ASAP. My dressing gown belt, soft like a teddy bear, mint green like a babies crib took on a form so ugly as it tightened itself around the wardrobes bar, securing itself so firmly, its dark potential indiscernible. As I let my weight go and blood filled up my head, it was the closest i've ever come to initiating death. As consciousness blurred and the grasp threatened control, there was indeed something putrid that the act embraced. Feelings of letting others down, as i cower and take the easy way out. The innocence of man so faraway and sweet. Who will deal with this and what kind of scar might it leave, forever taunting them unsubstantially with the horrors beneath. It wasn't right, and it wasn't the end. We take with us precisely what we leave with; The knots need to be undone first.That night I drank wine, as i failed in feeling, thought and form. To go on as usual keeping undercover this malignant crime. All angles whispered deception as paranoia gurned from the cracks. I was falling away from reality and cowered under a mask. In silence and in fear, there was nothing left to say. I had killed the Christmas spirit but was around for the aftermath.  My mind looped furiously convincing the monster to die away. Such narcissism void of goodwill, urging to trade good tears for cold blood. Such a vile abomination, what a disgusting creature i've become; lurking above, friend to no one. The future had spoken and this is my fate, judgement day was here and now it's too late. Trapped in a coil, unable to liberate, the pressure was unbinding; as theres no way to turn back time.The blackhole from where I lay reflected what I've become to this day, I woke up and prayed for night, just to hide away. Empty and alone, far away inside. Sucking soundly on destruction, damned off the face of the earth.Life still existed, it's exuberant treasures and delight. It's infinite possibilities, its eternal flame alight. I see the potential the soul interplays. It's creative reciprocation between the parts; but in darkness and in solitude you forfeit the power to engage. This type of doom, you can't just walk out of. It's exceeds shame and guilt, with the regret and the pain it spreads. It is a malignant stain that can't be erased, the choice of sorrow against the light of day. The denial of the transitory and fighting against time. The refusal to give up the demons of the mind. The evidence was loud and clear, this karmic debt was in. I will have to work my life in defeat if I ever hope to make it back. There was no sound sleeping for anyone in the house; who tried their best to ignore. There is no point using words, it empowers the cause even more.As days harshly passed, and cold winds pierced the heart. A raw and withered longing crept in once more. The Will to surrender to the hand up above, who provides tremendous shelter and pushes you forth. The memory of humour and Soloman's song, the play shall wait for you to accept your part.",1
757,"Back to reality after new year's : I had to spend the holidays with my family and their friends, and even though I don't like social situations and it's really overwhelming for me, it was nice to (at least somewhat) escape my parents. But it was hard for me to see that my cousins have a much better life in general: they live in a nice huge flat, are richer, and have a great relationship with their parents overall. And I envy them so much. I tried to spend as much time with their family as possible, and they were really nice to me, seemed interested about my hobbies and school, and gave me really nice christmas gifts (even though I'm not much of a fan of designer clothes, a Levi's hoodie is awesome and it's definitely the most expensive piece of clothing I own and I'm really thankful for it). But now I have to go back to our small flat full of things my mum was too lazy to throw out, to my lonely life with no friends, no one who cares about me. To my mum, who gets angry at me for the smallest things and never says anything nice to me, to my stepfather, who's a smoker and an alcoholic, who often shouts at me, who I'm always scared will rape me at some point of my life (I'm probably just paranoid, but I fucking hate him). Both wouldn't care if I told them how I feel. Both would kill me if they knew that the only time I feel somewhat happy is when I get drunk with my classmates, because ""smoking and drinking is fine when you are an adult and cause it's legal, but underage drinking or doing illegal drugs makes you a degenerate who doesn't deserve to be treated like a human being"", but that's a different story. I always feel like I'm just a spoiled brat and an angsty teenager, that my life is actually really good and I'm just ungrateful. But the truth is, that I've felt much happier and more accepted with the people I see maybe every other month at best than I've ever felt with my parents.",1

759,"Anti depressants killing sex drive? : Basically my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago was diagnosed with depression. It makes sense she lost her dad earlier this year and she's not been treated right at work, she started a course of anti depressants, she takes a tablet called Setraline? I think it's called that. Im trying my best to be there for her as much as possible, doing what I can to reassure her and just generally be there for her. Anyway, to the title... me and my girlfriend have gone from having the most amazing sex life to it being non existent this past couple of weeks, of course sex isn't at the fore front of her mind and that makes sense... however, something she said last night got me thinking âIs this normalâ?. We tried getting it on, and she said she wanted too but she felt guilty, as if she wanted to have sex with me but when we got close she felt a sense of guilt like she shouldn't and we just sort of stopped. Is this normal?",1

It's a combination of fear of wasted potential, not feeling like i am good enough, loneliness, anxiety and not being able to fit in all at once.And it slowly took everything away from me. My passions and hobbies slowly turned into chores, i couldnt pretend to be happy enough in front of my friends, and they tried to help me, but it was pointless, so we slowly turned into strangers. Relationships crumbled, as i tried to find in others what was missing inside me.And even though i am young and still could see and experience so many things, nothing seems to spark interest. I just want the pain to go away and be normal again. Why is that so hard?",1

It doesn't happen and I can't get it to. I feel like there's something wrong that this ability or natural reaction is gone for me. Maybe it would be helpful or cathartic to let things out, but I'm unable to get myself to cry. My depression mostly feels like nothingness instead of sadness, but there's a lot of sadness I think I need to feel to get over things, but it's like I can't make myself experience these emotions.Is there any way to get back this ability or these feelings? I take medications and see a therapist and psychiatrist, but they haven't helped in enabling me to experience emotions or be able to cry.",1
763,"Just new year : In 2019 i tried like hell. I forced myself out of my routine, tried new things, met new people, and took concrete steps to help manage my depression. I threw myself into my job and my hobbies trying to occupy my time with things i enjoy, or things i excel at.   I still spent every holiday alone, including my birthday, which affected me a lot more than I'd ever admit outside of reddit.   in 2019, i saw my friends get engaged, start families, accomplish their goals, and i saw myself become just a bit more bitter. How am i going to achieve anything when 100% of my energy is spent just trying to feel like myself again.   I used to be charismatic and fun. Now i can feel myself sucking the life out of the room.

767,"My mum died two days ago, my heart is hurting so bad : I feel like I will never stop crying and feeling teary. My heart feels so sad for my Mum who won't get to do the things she loved anymore. She'll never get to feel the warmth again and get a really dark tan like she always did. It destroys me that her death could have been possibly prevented if she had been treated sooner. She was only 54, she should still be here. I'm torturing myself thinking of all the stupid times that I didn't act the way I should have just because I was too depressed. Or the things I didn't do that she asked me too or hinted/suggested. I had the ability to make her happy and I didnt. I upset her just because of my negative mind and how effected she was by me. All the lost moments where I was in the room but my mind wasn't present in the slightest.She was suffering for a long time with alcoholism and unfortunately cancer took over her body. I feel like more could have been done to stop her from dying, I feel like I should have done more and been more helpful with her physical and mental health. I should have realised she was so unwell in the weeks before her death, there were days when I would look at her and just think oh god you look so unwell, why did I not say something? She might still be here if she had got to the hospital earlier. My heart hurts thinking about whether she was scared or worried. Whether she knew she was dying or had accepted her fate. Whether she knew she was leaving us and how distraught we were. When she was awake but delirious I couldn't look at her without crying, she must've known something was wrong because she almost never saw me cry. It brings me some peace to know she can't think and can't hurt anymore, her mind is resting and she is free from the pain of life.I honestly don't know how i'll get over this, I realise only now that she was such an important factor in my life, I depended on her and she depended on me. I should've been there for her.",1
768,"I don't pray : I grew up in a very christian household, we had good times for a while but then when it got bad it got bad. There was emotional and verbal abuses, alcoholism and plenty of other grievances to fall back onto to blame for my mental health in life after. But through all that my mother was there, she supported me and cared for me when I couldn't or didn't know how, she would call me her rock because I kept her happy calm and stable.But as time has gone on I've realized she was much more mine than I hers. I've struggled with depression since I was 6 years old and thoughts of suicide since 11, I'm 28 now and through all these years my mom has been there for me.This last year I got my heart broken, lost pets, my job but she was always there for me throughout. Ready to pick me up and give me a hug or tell me everything would be okay, that these pains and episodes of mental anguish would pass and she was always right.I wanted to buy her a house and give her grandchildren, buy her her dream car and get her some property to have a garden. I wanted to become a success so she'd never have to work another day in her life but I failed that.I took my time, telling myself there was plenty and I'd do it all some day.My mom died three weeks ago. There was no hints or build up, she was healthy one day and then I woke up into a dream I couldn't fall asleep in. My family is small, group of friends even smaller. As the days passed I took note of how many left my sphere, close friends I was there for are nowhere to be found.I lost religion a long time ago, I don't pray. But I prayed in that hospital, the hours waiting outside during surgery. I promised I'd be better, I promised I'd go to church every sunday for the rest of my days. I cried and begged and pleaded.And it all went unanswered. I felt like a fool, she would have never wanted me on my knees like that but I had to try and try I did.The silence is deafening for I am king leper; where are my toes?",1

While I've actually made a lot of progress on things, I keep comparing myself to people who are younger, have a house, a family, etc. It's making me feel so down on myself. And flat out bitter.

And for a while I managed to believe that but I've realised that it's just been a giant excuse for me to be able to escape my responsibilities and not be accountable when I was an asshole towards others because ""oh but my depression :c""It just doesn't add up to me. I've been in and out of hospital more times than I can count because I was *going* to kill myself but oh no, couldn't think of a way to do it in a way that was least harmful to everyone else so oopsies!! (this wasn't me, my doctor and my boyfriend have both stepped in to Make me go to hospital which i have hated but i guess part of me wants that attention and ""please admit me to the psych ward now i am big depression""). i am lazy and starved for attention and i find ways to get what i want by picking a random symptom of depression and amplifying it for sympathy. if I'm not doing that I'll take a random chest pain i felt 5 minutes ago and act like it's debilitating so i can lay in bed and watch Netflix and then realise i haven't been paying attention to the last 10 minutes and go back and let the same thing happen again. I've managed to get my high school to contact my state's education department to nullify basically half of my assessment material because I was routinely failing classes with an ""im depwessed :c"". if i was genuine i might have felt thankful but all i felt was guilt for effectively cheating my way into a high rankingI've managed to trick myself into believing it's real and I'm actually struggling and on the surface it makes sense because no normal person faking depression makes themself spend upwards of 6 hours in a hospital waiting room nearly twice a month but the more i think about it the less sense it makes. I'm fine. I'm not depressed or anxious or whatever I've managed to convince myself and others i am. i think a combination of low self esteem and laziness has embarrassed me into putting a more ""respectable"" (for a serious lack of a better word) label on it and I've become addicted to being a victim. even writing this I'm sure I've spun it to seem depressed but trapped by that whole thing where you question yourself and i keep thinking myself in circles about it but I'm fairly certain this is the truth at this point.",1

I've been going through a bad time these past couple of months with my depression hitting a new low now for the holidays. My fiancÃ© tried to be helpful at first.

I told him I didn't want to open up in this way because I knew he was going to take everything personally and end up making me feel even worse.

I have gotten up at 6:15 am five days a week for four months now, to go the cat shelter and give all our sick and special needs cats medicines. I love all the shelter cats as if they were my own. I recently just finished fostering a kitten who arrived on deaths doorstep at 10 days old and is now a healthy three month old.And I still feel empty. Useless. Depressed. I still daydream about killing myself. I feel worthless. I constantly think to myself about how I am a complete waste of time. How everyone just wants me gone.I feel like a horrible awful person. I think things like this while my cats sleep on my lap. I know on some level my cats love me and I care for them the best I can and yet I can't evict the negative thoughts. It's fucking unfair. I'm in the most fulfilling job I could ever have and I still can't feel happiness. What kind of sick joke is this?",1
794,"Ideally I'd [19F] love to build my life back up. Unfortunately, I don't know where/how to start. : Simply put, I'm the embodiment of *'loser'*. I've managed to cut more or less everyone out of my life either consciously or subconsciously. I'm an incredibly pessimistic personânaturallyâand I suppose people don't like that, which I understand and can't fault them for. You know when you see those Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc posts that are all, 'Cut those negative people out of your life'? Yeah. Needless to say, I spend my days at home, doing absolutely nothing. I've tried job searching but frankly, I'm feeling disheartened. I cannot for the life of me see what any hiring manager might see in me. I've managed to butcher two jobs already, and all thanks due to this wonderful organ residing in my skull. Without constant assurance that what I'm doing is right, I assume everybody hates me, and so naturally I begin to panic and everything turns to shit.My mum's reliably informed me that as a child, I'm everything she wants me *not* to be: introverted, withdrawn, inept to work, etc. I thought of voluntary work but as soon as I announced this, I was shunned because it didn't bring any money in. So, as someone who just loves people-pleasing, I sabotaged that opportunity, too. I'm more or less expected to work a job I dislike just for money which, frankly, makes me want to commit. I hate this persistent focus on money.My grades weren't amazing, either. I finished with a B and two Cs which, in the realms of A-Levels, isn't fantastic. It's enough to get into university, granted, but nothing great. I'm so disappointed in myself. Speaking of university, I doubt my abilities there also. I always was treated like I was thick during Sixth Form.I've been to the GP more times than I can count. Have tried five different anti-depressants before giving up because honestly, what's the point? My GP doesn't particularly care about me, either. They act like depression is a choice, even having gone as far as explaining it through a damn diagram. Wonderful. I can't afford private therapy and the waiting list for people on the NHS is unpredictable. I'm currently undergoing short-term counselling but that, too, is ineffective. I'm beginning to think that I've got TRDâbecause I've been trying to put conscious efforts into beating this, yet it feels momentous and impossible. I absolutely loathe myself. I know this is very black-and-white but I genuinely feel as though nothing will ever get better. I've even spent the entire holidays dreading the New Year, knowing people'll be celebrating new opportunities while I'm trying to hold it together. So I've no means of access to therapy, either financially or geographically; short-term counselling is ineffective, the NHS treats you like dirt on the bottom of their shoe if you so much mention the words 'mental illness'; my family is generally un-supportive and disbelieving; anti-depressants don't work; no motivation to maintain lifestyle changes; no friends, relationships, etc, and no belief in myself.Where do I go? How do I fix this? I feel so alone. It's ironic, considering depression is a global illness.",1

That word makes it sound really dramatic but really I don't wanna be here. It's too much and I'm not enough. I was just texting a friend this morning.

Due to a lot of family drama and deaths I went into my freshman year hormonal and in the worst mental state of my life. Now over the past two years I've only gotten worse and I don't know what to do. Now I'm a YouTube addict. I literally spend all my free time trying to escape through watching YouTube. I'm depressed so I take Prozac, but it's made me not give a shit about anything. I've lost a lot of my empathy, and now I'm a selfish hermit who never does homework and never visits family. I'm addicted to vaping thc carts of weed. It makes my mind stop talking and I can just listen to music for hours. My mind doesn't work anymore, and I'm in all honors classes but I can't keep up with any of them because my brain is so fucked. I'm literally in the worst state  I've been in my whole 16 years of life but the Prozac makes me feel numb to it and I have no motivation to change. I mean, I kind of do have motivation since I'm writing this I guess. Either way, Watching my grades drop and watching my friends succeed is eating away at me, since I used to be one of them. I've just spiraled into a loafer with no drive or attention span. Now it's half way through the school year and it's too late to drop my honors courses, so now I have to finish the school year with ass grades and look like an idiot. I just don't know what to do. Chronic depression, chronic procrastination, addiction to weed and internet, and biting off more than I can chew have destroyed my self esteem and essentially dug me into a hole. Look at my life objectively and logically, what should I do to move forward? I like don't know where to start at the moment... and I feel like I won't last long without some kind of roadmap.

812,"One of my best friends committed suicide a few months back. Starting to think he had the right idea. : So about a month ago I found out that one of my oldest and dearest friends died way back in August. It took weeks after learning about his death from his family (from whom he was estranged, and who in turn waited months to tell any of his friends that he had died in the first place) to finally find out that it was indeed suicide, which many of us suspected was the cause. We all knew each other from working at summer camp together, indeed this guy was my counselor and mentor before he was a friend and an equal, and we all live all over the place so we often go months without seeing or talking with each other. Hence why none of us found out for months.But that's not exactly what I want to talk about here. I've been struggling with depression, often manageable but at times quite debilitating, for basically my whole life, certainly my whole âadultâ?life, and really since at least age 11 or so (for the record, I'm 26 now). I'm so incredibly fortunate to have family and social circles (small, but there) who are at least sympathetic and to have had access to therapy and medication for many years. And while it's hard to say I've ever thrived living with depression, I have had some successes in my life: I finished high school and university with good grades, I've made some really great friends, I've done some writing which I'm actually halfway proud of, I've had one really great romantic relationship for two years - and when that relationship ended a little over a year ago, it ended on good terms and my ex and I are still friends. And, least or perhaps most of all, I'm still alive. I'm still here. But this last point at least is starting to feel less like an achievement and more like a weakness.I've never believed suicide was âthe cowards way out,â?nor have I ever understood why people often react with anger towards a loved one who commits suicide. Or maybe I should say, I understand, but I don't sympathize with that point of view. My sympathy has only ever laid with those who kill themselves, and when I found out about my friend this was my reaction as well; now that the shock has worn off, I feel nothing but sympathy, and a hope that his pain is truly over now.I've also for a long time now held some fairly dark and fatalistic views about life in general, which I realize is almost certainly heightened if not directly the result of my depression, but my thoughts about this still resonate. That we are all doomed to die, and anything we experience in terms of achievements and happiness are fleeting, that in the end we will all be forgotten by the nothingness of infinite time. And further, that even the easiest and happiest life is filled with suffering. Maybe even that life itself is a bad thing, defined by suffering and sustained by an impossible desire to make it last as long as possible.Yes, I know. I know how doom and gloom this all sounds, that it very clearly emanates from depression and sounds a bit like an angsty teenager's pseudo-philosophical diary scribbles. And it's also worth noting that this year, the last couple of years really, has been really pretty rough. I can't hold down a job, my girlfriend and I broke up, I moved back in with my parents, and I can see all of my old friendships slowly withering. God, how much I want to have a beer with a friend and have it not feel like I'm being done a favor out of pity. God, how I want to have my hand held in an intimate gesture, I miss it all so much. And of course, all of this is hitting me particularly hard on New Year's Day. Doubt that's a coincidence. Not really asking for specific advice, to be honest just writing this has made me feel a bit better. I'm also going to post this on /r/suicidewatch, though even after just writing this I don't feel in any imminent danger right now. Thanks for reading",1

814,"I'm stuck (18F) : It's the first day of the new year and I don't think I've felt more depressed in my life. I'm in college and have a 3 week break at home, and while it's nice to have that break, I feel like shit in my hometown. It's so depressing and just reminds me of how much I hated high school and how I had no friends.    Depression runs in my family, my Mom has it and my Dad is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Not much of a surprise that I feel the same way (also they're divorced). I've been feeling this way for about a year, since my second semester of senior year in high school. I don't know how to explain it, like I'm definitely not bipolar but I seem to have a lot more âoffâ?days than I'd like. One thing, one moment just puts me off for the rest of the day. Being alone at school doesn't help either, living in a single dorm and all. Like, I love having independence and doing my own thing but shit gets so depressing sometimes. School is the only thing I have to live for bc I get excited, I want to learn, being on campus gives me a sliver on hope for society.     I have 2 sisters (I'm the middle), and we're all super close. I'm very close with my mom as well, and I've told them how I feel depressed (but I obviously can't self-diagnose). My sisters support me through everything but I know they can't fix my problems, just make life a little easier to live through. I've tried to have serious conversations about it with my Mom, but she just has so much on her plate everyday. My little sister was recently diagnosed with anxiety and started going to counseling again. We've seen symptoms when she was younger but it's gotten worse. She's attempted to hurt herself a couple of times and it breaks my heart. Since my older sister and I are at college and she's home alone, I can only imagine what she's going through. With that, I feel like my Mom doesn't take me seriously. I'm always âoverthinking it, being dramatic, or sensitiveâ? Usually one of her 3 responses to my âepisodesâ?      I want to seek help, idk if medication is the next step or what. Counseling sessions are booked at my school, idk how I'd be able to stay consistent with that while going to school. I just want someone to understand.",1
815,"A New year a new me (long) : I have suffered from depression for the past couple of years and last year i planned to take my life and had everything ready on last New Years, but I didn't, the reason is I had read a comment saying if someone throws you a life reserver, you owe it to yourself to swim to it so you can eventually get on the boat instead of drowning. While still being at my worst at this point I made changes to improve myself, I lost a ton of weight and have little to no anxiety apart from the times I took weed edibles etc. I did other changes but mainly in moderation and nothing super extreme beyond fasting long for weight loss. I know I didn't push myself to my full potential, I messed days up, and I mean that's fine but I got off track and into a depressive state after those days, every New Years I reevaluate my life, to be or not to be, and whether i did myself right that year and how or whether I want to approach the next year at all. This year I'm cutting all the bullshit and giving myself an almost ultimatum year where I push myself harder than I ever have to see if I can do it and whether there's something out there worth it for me. I am going to give myself the best fighting chance I can. It's easy to wallow in this rut and just be consumed by it, and don't get me wrong It's hard not to get consumed by the thoughts in your head. But...I personally believe we should try and be the best we can be for a year to help ourselves improve and learn and even get out of the big sad. If we don't fight what's the fucking point right?I read a post I think on here where they named their depression frank... I mean it's also known as monkey brain. This has helped me quite a bit over the past year But yeah once you are thinking of something you know is frank, say hi frank you can piss off now. Or swiper no swiping lol (Dora depressed lol) but basically identifying thoughts and associating it with frank and not yourself is a good step to identify and filter out frank. From there I like to torture frank, franks goal is to get you to quit routines and hobbies and get you doing less and less so he can poison your thoughts when you are in bed with thoughts all day or night. The way to torture this fuck named frank is to make him uncomfortable and show that he has no control over the physical domain(you). flex your arm right now, it sure as hell was not frank so you are the one in control, remember that, if you have seen stranger things  where they turn the heat up on will (https://youtu.be/--j5sGlrqMk) you have to do things that make frank uncomfortable and torture him, and the greatest thing is just all these torture methods are good for you and not frank, cold showers are great for you to torture frank and make you feel alive, if you have ever exercised or ran and then jumped into a cold ass shower you leave the shower feeling amazing, rejuvenated and alive( if you listen to music while showering or to hype yourself up for something listen to kickstart my heart, shits a god damn drug to me,it hypes me the fuck up.) torture methods also include exercise, have you ever thought of wanting to die or even just thinking in general when you are benching weight over your chest/neck, hell no. I am personally going to challenge many things I have already been doing and some I have been slacking on and new challenges.My list includes; 4:30 am mornings and on weekends or holidays max sleep in of 7 am, No masturbation for the whole year, its a tool for procreation and not for a dopamine hit. You will ruin your dopamine reward system and testosterone and nutrients each time. Anyways it will make you more social at least in my findings over the past year. cold showersexercise/train hard with a program( up to you) and only 2 days off for recovery at max. Get light body weight/cardio on these days. half hour+of meditation and a counsellor for guidance when needed. 2 day bulking fasting routine(snake diet)(side note if you need to lose weight do snake diet prolonged fasts, I've lost over 100lbs on it, just do it, it will make your life so much easier and better. It changes your mindset, if you can drop a ton of weight with some self discipline, what's stopping you from changing other parts of your life including mental health with real discipline and effort, which leads me to this post and my new years resolution)Beyond that no drugs or alcohol of any kind under any occasion, dry year.learn guitar and master 12 songs at least(singing too). Improve the workload I can carry at work and become a master in my field and take on new projects. Get honour role in school and hit the grind hard early and get shit done early so I'm not stressing out.Naturally these habits will replace filler activities/bad habits/depressive habits like gaming/Netflix/getting high/staying in bed from 5pm to bedtime stuck in your head, for hours on end. I have pretty much cut all of these out, I need to work on YouTube a little still, I have already cut down my subscriptions to people I actually watch and enjoy and that might only be 2 to 3 videos a day I watch. Maybe one for you is social media addiction, I don't use social, get off that shit, that ding notification dopamine hit you get, oh who texted me etc. What did this person post, why am I not getting likes on this post etc. Also if you post god damn everything you do online, there is nothing to talk about with another person for example. Ask the person what they did last weekend and be a human instead of scrolling and not talking to them. I know this is a depression subreddit and not get motivated or other subreddits like that, but this is where I call home for the past few years, I just wanted to share my guidelines I will follow for the year to decide it all. I know I am not the only one who would lurk posts or posts and then instantly deletes the post, Or even post and look at the comments to reconfirm that you have the right to feel that way. I'm tired of feeling bad all the time and letting self pity occur and hope that maybe if I just outthink frank that everything will be better, you can't outthink feelings. it's time to quit bullshitting myself and actually push myself to get better and be better. If anyone would like to join me this year on some challenges maybe we can have a thread dedicated to people who want to fight their depression to death. I'm tired of feeling and living this way and I'm sure I'm not the only one.",1

I have no bad memories with him, id call him once or twice a week, see him whenever I could. He was always ill and his own son is a heroin addict and acts as such. We were extremely close, he was the only person I could truly talk to about anything.When I got the news, I felt like he was the only reason I made it this long and Im spiraling like crazy now. He was the buffer I had from realizing how rough of a life I have had, self induced or otherwise. Backstory to follow.I grew up living with my mom and visiting my godparents frequently. My dad quit coming around when I was 10 and back when I was 19 after I graduated basic. We moved around every year to different city or state, I didnt really make a lot of friends until late middle school years. My mom married a man who was very controlling, unfaithful and abusive in a non physical manner. I  left for the navy in 2011 do to intel and ultimately ended up doing special operations work. I had also gotten married and divorced, im now remarried to someone who cares for me deeply, but has been unfaithful, and done a lot of other things that I question. When I got back from my last tour with a special operations unit and leading up to my godfathers death, I just have never felt right. I had a huge breakdown in Germany while heading home. I have cut ties with toxic people where I see fit. My mother and I had a big falling out after I got back as well over something as dumb as me getting a piercing, yet my tattoos dont bother her. We are still on bad terms despite my apologies.I have been with 3 counselors for the above issues, including PTSD from my deployments. Im still managing to do alright in school for engineering technology, and I play guitar for a band and write my own music. I left the Navy and im searching for my career path while doing the aforementioned.I just feel like its all too much, that I have hurt so many people, that I am a burden, and I am cursed to be a toxic and unhappy person. I havent thought about death until the last few weeks but its such a peaceful thought. My last therapist was very helpful with my self deprecating thoughts but she moved across the country.The pain it would cause my wife is why I do not follow through and why I havent made an attempt.Thank you for reading my story, and please do not be too alarmed. I think if I can make it back to therapy I may be okay. Just getting it off my chest a little is helpful.",1

821,"My brother died and i am an INTROVERT : I am writing this because i am really depressed. More than than that i feel lonely. I live jn India. My elder brother died 3y ago (22at the time) in an accident. The only person i talked with was my brother. I have many good memories of him. He was so supportive. And suddenly he died. The last time I saw my brother was 1week before his death. What really hurts is that I am an introvert and i really don't want to be one. There's really no one to share my feelings after my brother died. My parents workaholic and deeply religious(its a bit over). They really don't understand my feelings. I even told them that i am alone and depressed and thar i have no friends. My dad in the morning goes to work and evening to the prayer meetings and doesn't spend much time with the family. I do believe in God but I think my parents are over religious. My mom is also religious but she would often let me do what i want even it is something that my father doesn't like.It was during my highschool my brother died. His memories were actually a boost for me in studies.  I usually cry remembering those times and then fo to study. I cleared one of the toughest exam in India(more than 1.5million did the test).Now I'm in college doing a professional course and living in a rented room(shithole) and most of  classmates are staying in the University hostel. My parents won't allow me to stay there. Since i am an 'Outsider'my classmates doesn't even care about me. I am literally alone.In my highschool there was this one girl that i liked. I always wanted her to be my girlfriend. I mean in Kerala even though a developed state in India and not like ROI, we are bit lagging in accepting bf gf relationships. So everyone had their GFs secretly. The funny and at the same time painful thing is that i don't know where she is now. In my college i tried to talk with some girls but it didn't go very well. Now every fuckin girl know that i am an introvert and they don't  even talk or even smile at me. What a fuckin loser i am.Now my whole college life is now ruined.  I don't know what i should do now. I am completely alone and depressed. My life is a total silence and the silence is killing me.

Imagine having a depression since 5 years old and every time i see someone die at that young age, i realize , how i wish that was me lying in that coffin because they don't have to suffer anymore.   And every time that happens i see myself in dark corner of our house trying to cry but can't .  Now that i am going to be 21 this year I want to End it all because IT IS HARD. It is so hard that  any moment i found myself crying for no reason and I space out every time that i can't get my work done. I can't even enjoy the things i enjoy before. Now, I can't even get to show, to my family, my true smile. Every time there is family gathering I feel exhausted because i can't show  to them that I am sad, it's hard to disguised yourself as happy when the truth is your depressed inside.

My depression is generally undetectable if you don't already know me.But I've noticed a pattern in myself. I (accidentally) make acquaintances quite easily, and I seem to 9 times out of 10 regret establishing some form of contact with them. I have an undeniable sense of dread whenever my phone rings.I try my best to push through what seems to be commitment issues, but after a while, I'll dissolve our connection. It usually has nothing to do with how the person acts. I feel like a terrible person, and a very bad friend. Once in a while I'll reach out and say hi, but I don't like constantly hanging out.The worst part is that I don't know how to explain it. I am perfectly happy being alone, and I even prefer being alone most times. I can't ever seem to word it properly as an explanation to why I'm so hard to get ahold of, and when I do, I just come off as super weird. It's completely uncharacteristic of how I am when I'm in direct contact with someone, which I try to avoid at all costs.tl;dr: I wanna know if anyone can relate to disassociating with good people for no clear reason.

840,"I can't be happy the same time as everyone else around me : It started off as a stupid theory. But over time believe it or not I have statistical data proving how insane the dynamic of my happiness compared to those around me is.Essentially, the days/weeks/month/years that I am happy, and I mean truly happy; I notice my friends and my family are suffering. It's uncanny.The latest example would be the past year I've spent living with my ex girlfriend. I essentially had everything in my life going right for me. However my friends were suffering from loneliness. My family was suffering from financial stress. October 10th 2019 ended my running. My best friend committed suicide. That same week consisted of me somehow losing my apartment, my MacBook, the next month I split up with old girl, and as the holidays came around I realized once again I've been stripped of everything good in my life........and like clockwork every single one of my friends found someone. My parents made it through. It's almost as though I'm the sacrificial lamb who must endure extraordinary pain and loneliness in order to have those around me happy. It's happened so many times, that I truly believe this theory. It's one thing never being happy. It's another thing being happy only when nobody else around you is. The timing is impeccable. I'm almost positive the moment I start gaining things that give me a reason to enjoy my life, once again people around me would lose what they have. And we never are happy at the same time. Assuming these aren't thoughts of a madman and it's factual, what would you do? Would you sacrifice your immediate happiness in order to watch everyone you love be happy? Or are you fine with watching your own people suffer while you enjoy life? I've been depressed most of my life. And for once I don't want to get better.

851,Where to go from here : I've been battling depression for almost 6 years. Some days are better than other but for the past year it feels like it's getting worse by the day. I recently did something I now vary much regret. I helped my closest âfriendâ?break into a veterinarian office to steal drugs(ketamine). I didn't think he'd do it but now I have to pay the price. I should have told him no. I didn't say no because he's the closest thing I have to a friend these days. This feels like rock bottom but every time I think it's rock bottom it's not.

852,"Is this normal? : I tend to get a lot of symptoms that I'm becoming increasingly concerned about. I wanted to check if others experience them too.Along with the usual symptoms (e.g low mood, emotional numbness, apathy, low energy, etc), I also experience the following:**Inability to focus:** My attention span and mind in general constantly feels very scattered, making it hard to focus on something as simple as reading. Trying to focus is painful not only because it puts a cognitive strain on me, but I can also sometimes get headaches from it.**Headaches/migraines:** Almost every day. They generally start either as a pain behind my eyes or a feeling of tension in the centre of my head or behind my forehead. The tension can last the entire day once it starts.**Nausea:** It does't matter how full or empty my stomach is, I often feel nauseated. If I don't direct my attention away from the nausea and focus on the feeling the nausea will worsen and I'll start to wretch.**Lack of appetite:** I think this one is very much linked with my increasing inability to enjoy things (including food). I rarely feel hungry, and when I do nothing really seems all that appealing.**Fatigue &amp; grogginess:**  No matter how much sleep I get, I feel constantly drained.**Pains:** I often get pains in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen, especially after eating. I've had an ultrasound scan of my abdomen done and nothing out of the ordinary was found.**Feeling stupid in general.** I don't feel anywhere near as sharp as I felt before the depression. It takes a while for me to process things and I have difficulty remembering things. I tend to zone out quite a lot.In case you guys are wondering, I've had multiple blood tests done for things like hyper/hypothyroidism and lymphoma. Nothing showed up to be out of the ordinary.Are these kinds of things normal for depression? Do you guys experience them too? I'm quite worried.Thanks in advance \^\^",1

873,"The person I consider my best friend is not reciprocal and that is about to destroy me : I am a genuinely introverted person, so it was extremely difficult for me to make this friend in 2019. It all started at the beginning of last year. We took some classes together, but I never spoke to him then. One day he arrived with a GOT shirt, I asked about it and we started texting since then and I found we shared a lot of things. I proposed him to study with me for the final exams of that semester, he accepted and that was how I got to know him much more (or at least I thought I knew him).I was very happy to have a friend, after years without success. We kept communicating during vacations and the new semester began. Now we did everything together, lunch, study, we took the same classes. I spent almost all day with him. The only bad part, perhaps, was that while I always offered him my academic help,  he was not trying to do anything for me (not even asking how my day was). I let that happen because my happiness blinded me. One day he started to get away from me and did it progressively until we barely talked during classes and the conversation became very uncomfortable. I talked to him about the way I felt and he told me that he had started dating a girl, that she made him feel really blissful, so he asked me to please understand that. ""I will spend less time with you, maybe we don't have lunch together anymore, won't go to the movies together, but we'll still be friends."" I tried to understand him but I couldn't help feeling jealous, besides I felt now he was uncomfortable being with me. I decided to stop talking to him and I informed him that, which he took very well. At that moment my suicidal tendencies began. I did not understand why, I was happy without having friends before and now I felt so weak and helpless by a person I did not know the previous year. I guess my weak character makes me dependent on anyone who is 'nice' with me. My dog ââdied two weeks after that, she was the only one who had been helping me overcome all  that crap, my true friend from the beginning, someone whom I loved deeply. I tried to kill myself twice, I failed both. My 'friend' knew about my suicidal tendencies but did nothing to help me. However he was happy, why would he bother to understand my stupid problems?On the last day of the last semester he decided to talk to me, he was a little drunk and asked if we could start from scratch. I agreed stupidly, which I am very sorry for. I agreed because I had no one else, moreover I had the clumsy idea that I could be happy again. Nothing further from reality. It does not answer most of my messages (messages that I write 2 or 3 times a week to not drive him crazy). He has not answered my greeting for the New Year and I still think he will need my help the following semester. I think ending that relationship would only destroy me. I have truly come to feel much steem for him and I still admire his extroversion. I'm already miserable enough, I don't want to ruin it again. What I can do? I have no one else.",1

At the time we both agreed we would stay at her parents for a few weeks for a little extra help.

I understand but I also dont want to burden her family so I go home to our apartment and stay thinking she is going to be home in a week or so. Another month goes by and she does not want to come home. She says it for the convenience of being at her moms. So now I'm home alone and I miss my family. After a couple more months of arguing over her not being home our relationship has gotten weak and distant but we have a routine now and I am asked to watch my son while she works sundays. I have been paying the rent on my own now because she says she makes no money at work. I struggled with that bad.Around the same time my work van with all my tools get stolen, my livelihood. Shortly after I am had a scare that involves my blood pressure but at the time I was scared. I was at work and started getting dizzy, my eyes turned into static and I blacked out. Finally she speaks up and tells me she loves me but is not in love with me anymore. She is not coming back. So now I feel pathetic because I am moving out of our apartment because I do not need this space and cant afford it by myself. I am begging for her to try for our family.I have been at a really bad low since she first decided not to come home. On top of this I am dealing with the financial stress of the apartment and having to buy a new van new tools a deposit on a room for rent a storage unit ,etc. I drive on the freeway and notice every gap in the railing I can drive off of .

But so many things that are wrong with this world and so many things happening that just make me feel so insignificant..What was that starved to death child in Africa's destiny? What was that baby that died at births destiny? What was the 1345th person out of 5000 that commit suicide in the UK every years destiny?... I watched this video on Youtube the other day about 5 teens getting sentenced to jail for murder. They were throwing large stones off a bridge onto a motorway and one of them killed a father of 3 on his way home from work... And i seen a comment on it that said âImagine living your whole life, having kids with your wife only to be killed on your way home from work by some stupid teensâ?... And fuck that hit hard.. That guy is now dead. That guy that contributed more to society and probably more for his kids then I've done in my life and his existence was just wiped out. Some kids just doing stupid kid stuff and shot that man out of existence. Now what the fuck was his destiny??.. Where was the âeverything falls into place at the right timeâ?meaning in his fucking story....It really makes me think on how nothing actually really fucking matters.

And how many of those people do you have the faintest clue about that existed..We like to fill our heads with bullshit on how we are the centre of the Universe and all that shit but you really think god cares about the 1 of his infinite living creations.. We are the most intelligent species on our planet but our lives hold as much significance as that ant you accidentally stepped on on your way to work. Or that spider you killed because you didn't like the way it looked. Or that flower you picked that eventually withered and died..If there is any meaning to our very very very short time we spend being sentient. It is what we give it.. And I can't see anything more meaningful than trying your best to embody good in this cruel world.. This world suffers so much and there's nothing that should make you feel more proud of your existence than doing what is right.. You have to look out for yourself and your own well-being but give some of what you have spare to others..This world needs kindness and compassion and generosity more than ever.. We as humans have the most tainted past. But strive to be the difference..Give your spare change to that homeless man. Let someone infront of you in queue. Give up your seat for someone standing on public transport. Stand in protest against climate change, corrupt governments, unjustified wars, terrorism, poverty, homelessness, Etc.. All the little things create just that little bit extra kindness in the world.. All of you that are on this board know pain. Know suffering. Know what it is like to fester in negativity..Don't be a multiplier of this pain.. Be an example of the society that you wished you lived in.. You may not contribute as much as you want towards society. But you gave abit of whatever light you have left to someone else. And made there light just abit brighter. In that moment you were the god that gifted someone else. Wether that be stopping a kid from being bullied or sparing the life of that spider.. At that moment you were in charge of making a difference to someones life. And you gave them happiness. And that gives your life meaning...",1

I'm just going through all the motions, and I'm starting to panic a bit because everybody is acting like this is completely normal. Like I keep telling them something is very wrong with me right now and no one believes me or sees anything wrong. I'm scared because I feel so disconnected from everything I used to love, including the people around me. I'm really stressed about it and I am not sure how to help this.

This year wasn't different at all; my SO came visit me in my city and I had the happiest week in years with him, yet I couldn't be 100% happy for reasons I have no idea why. Now that he's gone I'm sad af again. I can say I'm unhappy pretty much the entire year, but summers make me a hundred times more depressed, I think it's because seeing people happy and having the time of their lives make me jealous or something.

881,"Anyone else overcome with numbness? : I'm (32F) medicated for long-standing depression and anxiety. The medication is working, and I'm not suicidal. The issue is, most days I'm not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don't do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can't sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don't have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don't feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness. My question is, is there anything one can do to break through the numbness, or even soften it a bit? I don't want to cease the medication, because prior to taking it I wasn't functioning. But I feel like I'm living a half-life, in a bubble where I am watching everything unfold but nothing is touching me.",1

But surprisingly I was having fun and talked to a bunch of people and even started conversations (!!!). I guess the alcohol helped a bit... When I got home I was really proud of myself for going to the party and especially talking to people and not sitting in a corner quietly. The feeling of making progress gave me a little confidence boost.Fast forward to now. When I think back I feel like I was putting on a mask so I look like I am a social and fun person. Thinking about those conversations really makes me cringe because now they feel so fake and pointless. Like I was just having them to have a smooth, non-awkward evening and staying in my ""party persona"". I get the same feeling when I think about times where I opened up to my 2 best friends about having mental problems. In those moments I really had the feeling that I am making progress and this will help me. And even though they listened to me now it just feels like being a burden and a cry-baby.

896,"I am struggling with every aspect of my life : Background: 27/F of south asian decent. I struggled a lot with my feeling in highschool. I has a estranged relationship with my parents. They had moved to Canada and has white collar jobs back home but here they felt frustrated and more often than not they would take it out on me. I worked on farms and helped ends meet. I quickly realized I wasn't quite like the other kids, falling for boys and doing the popular thing. I started to become very internalized and depressed. I even tried to kill myself a few times. But I was chicken shit and never did manage to succeed. My parents pressured me to do online classes skip a grade and be smart. I did most, but in grade 12 I was struggling a lot. I finished school with a great GPA, but I never finished my online class. I just had too much on my plate( my mental health was really bad here) anyways I decided to switch my major and take that class while I did the other intro classes at school. I told my parents, they decide I was horrible and I got yet another beating. I tried to keep it up. I was 17 and too scared to take a student loan so I got a night job and started working and school.during the day. With my mental health being the way it was and animosity at home I was struggling. My grades at school.staryed to drop, I started to get worse and worse. After two semester and realizing I wasnt going to succeeed I decided to quit school, I moved out and spent a month just sleeping. I was so mentally exhausted. I then looked for a job. I found a decent job working in a lab, I started to save as I eventually wanted to return to university. I went back to tutoring, since I was tutoring in highschool some of my networks were still around, so I approached them. Back in highschool I used to tutor at my parents home. The students asked if I was able to do that again. I approached my parents hesitant, offered to share part of my earning and tutor there. They said sure 50-50. Hey that was more money than I was making now so it would only help me save more. Time goes on, our relationship seems better, they tell me they miss me and I should move home. I am foolish because I believe them as I am moving home a year later. Enrolling in local college to do a bridge program and get into the program I want. I am lonely and have no friends and my parents are back to yelling and hating me. I look for friends more importantly I am looking for love. Highschool people made jokes about me being gay to me, I ignored them. Ofcourse they weren't wrong. But I wasn't the in crowd so I couldn't afford to be gay aswell. So here I am thinking I am on path to sorting my shit out at 19 and I meet this woman at the college. She seems really interested we hit it off, she tell me she loves me and I am puddy. I do everything she wants. Things at my home are tense so i find any and every excuse to stay out and with her. One day she needs financial help and I being an idiot let her have my savings with a promise she will return them within a semester and then she changes. She starts seeing exes and new people. She calls me names, she makes me feel gross about myself and I gain a bunch of weight. My doctor says my health is no good. I am hardly sleeping. I am prescribed xanax. I hate it so I just let myself cry for days and not leave my room. I started seeing a counselor at the college. Cut back to taking just one class so I can have health insurance and work for a year and half and save. Get a car. My.parents are fighting everything i do. Constantly calling me names, I am still being beat up. I start going to jiu jitsu. At 24, I get a handle on my head a bit. I have sat down and decide I am.taking a student loan and studying. I study hard and finishing the engineering bridge program. I have meet someonei think I like I am taking it slow.I had applied to school close but not in the same city so I could justify moving. I am 25 So I move to the island near my city and get admission to a good engineering school. I go to visit the person I have been seeing. I like her, I am open with her, she understands my past. She is sick though and getting better. She is living in south africa with her family. I only see her for 2 weeks. I return start university. I work my ass off and focus. I get an internship. I work hard, I struggle, I am sad every day. I am 26,My mother had gone through my bank stuff and found I has bought a vibrator. We fight, yells and tells me how much of disgrace I am. I have a ring I had bought for the woman I had been seeing. She is sick and can't move to canada so I want to marry her. That find sends me backwards. I had to tried to tell me parent a million times how I feel and the fact i gay, she keeps bringing up marriage to men. If she find a purchase so horrible how will she react to me marrying a woman. I tell my girlfriend how I am feeling, she tells me not to worry and do it at my pace and take my time. She tells me she is okay, she will wait as long as it takes. I see her again for 2 weeks, I love her and her family loves me. Seeing them makes me feel like I am so alone. I feel lonely most days but i am very aware now. I am sitting here today watching everyone post a recap of their decade showing their accomplishments and here is am.not even halfway through my degree, lonely and scared, uncomfortable in my skin. Unsure of how to come out how to find a balance between the guilt I feel for not being a good daughter or staying in hiding and forever losing the person I love if not today then someday. I am sitting here in tears wondering when things got so messy, when I became so alone, when no one remembers my birthday, no one wishes me for holidays. Where my depression is now crippled with anxiety and I am fatter and unhealthier than I have ever been. Okay it is too long I will stop now!",1
897,"Why can I never win? : I feel like I can never win. If I wake up in an okay mood, something comes my way and I'm back at square one and wanting to kill myself all over again.

And now I'm all alone and at this point, at this age, it's *impossible* to make these primary school type of naive, sincerely kinds of friendships. Oh, how I wish I could go back in time like in my dreams..",1
899,"I want to kill two people that were once my friends(Long) : This is kinda long, but I want to get it out. I grew a pretty decent friend group in college, as I was pretty outspoken in class. We'd have get together's at my place, go to movies, and have LAN parties, usual nerdy college friend stuff. I liked them all, but I grew the closest to one I'll call Duke. Duke was the most level guy I knew, and was a good solid ground if I got too depressed. He was at my house nearly everyday, a lot of the time even slept over, my place was basically a second house to him. I soon realized he was the best thing in my life. 10 months ago he died in a car crash.&amp;#x200B;The two people I want to kill were in the friend group. They're a couple, I'll call them Adam and Jesse. My problems with them started two years ago, me and Adam shared the same job, so we'd see each other a lot and became closer as friends. I think that closeness is what started me realizing they're weren't good people. One time on break I asked if they could clean their house and if I could help, he responded by threatening to kill me, then Jesse texted me saying I was an asshole and never to insult them again. Mind you, it wasn't just 'Day old McDonalds cups sitting around', a closer definition would be some of the rooms on NeckbeardNests, but the whole house. I'll add that I'm really bad at confrontation, so not wanting to lose them as friends and feeling bad that I insulted them I offered to pay for books that Jesse needed for school, Adam had brought up that they were always low on money and didn't have enough for them.&amp;#x200B;Later I got a girlfriend, a friend of Jesse's. But for me, managing work and a girlfriend wasn't possible at the time. It ended on a day I was feeling super down, I was staying the night at her place and couldn't sleep because I was so upset, gf didn't like that and and we had an argument all night, me trying to explain it wasn't her fault I was depressed, and her claiming she knows what I'm doing, ""Just using depression to run away from problems"". She broke up with me a few days later over text. In that time I tried to get advice form Jesse and Adam on how to handle things and, admittedly, validate how I feel. I was expecting Jesse to be to be somewhat defensive since she was her friend, but was incredibly upset at me. Being already in a state of depression, their lack of compassion toward how I felt hit me hard. I lost my job and lost contact with them after Adam threatened to kill me if I didn't stop talking to them.&amp;#x200B;Back to 10 months ago. A bit before Duke died I'd been trying to reconnect with Adam and Jesse, stupid yeah, but I'm a stubbornly caring guy, so stuff like that bothers me. And then it happened, a few hours later I was at the hospital and got a call from Jesse, saying that her and Adam ""loved"" me and that they're sorry about Duke. A few days later I suggested that all us in the friend group hang out, just to shoot the s\*\*\*. Since Duke was usually at my place, it would've brought up memories, so we decided to have it at Adam and Jesse's. I was supposed to be happy seeing everyone again and hanging out, but I just couldn't get over how A and J they treated me. Knowing they wouldn't apologize or bring it up I just left. I got a text from Jesse, ""We should just forget about it, move on"", I took that as ""We don't want to take responsibility for being terrible"". Later they'd agreed to go see a movie and invited me, I said screw and went, maybe I could just look past it, but in the lobby, in front of the rest of my friends in front of several people Jesse basically told me again, ""Move on, forget what happened in the past. Being un-confrontational I silently agreed and we all watched the movie, the whole time I was mulling over how they were acting, and how they got all of the rest of the friend group to side with them. It really burned.&amp;#x200B;After the movie I had to drive, I usually did it to get my mind off things, but it didn't help. I'd just lost the guy I could call my best friend, almost a brother, and these two were still doing they're underhanded, manipulative games. I went to their house, knocked on the door and told them that we needed to sort this out in person, the three of us sit down and talk about stuff, I just wanted to get that closure. Later I git a lot of hate texts from the other friends, ""You gave Jesse a panic attack"", ""She's super scared"". Adam told me to never talk to them again and filed a restraining order. So everyone thinks I'm a crazed lunatic and have no way to convince my other friends otherwise. I was alone at this point.&amp;#x200B;Flash forward to the Duke's funeral. I hadn't spoken to anyone for a few weeks before it, so I came in pretty angered, but what pushed me over the edge was seeing Adam and Jesse outside the church laughing with my other friends. I know it wasn't at Duke or at me, but seeing them happy after all the things they did and how I felt just broke me. I didn't talk to anyone at the funeral, didn't make eye contact, just sat there in a rage crumpling the funeral pamphlet in my hand. I was walking out and stopped at his car, just stared at it for a while then kicked in the rearview mirror and kicked some dents into the door, they came outside as I was walking off, called Jesse and Adam harsh names. I 100% admit that that wasn't the right choice, it scarred Duke's family and most likely cemented in my other friend's mind that I was crazy, but dammit if it wasn't the most satisfied I felt in a long time. I got an arrest warrant, had to pay $300, and I'm still on probation for a few months. I didn't go to the court hearing, I knew if I saw them again I'd fly off again.&amp;#x200B;Fast forward to now, I've cut ties with all my friends that didn't cut them with me, even with my mom who, in my eyes, was in defense of Adam and Jesse. I don't trust people, and can't stand the thought of making new friends or any other relationship. Added on to that, Everytime I see their actual names, see someone's face in a movie that vaguely looks like theirs, see someone getting married, are boyfriend of girlfriend, or see any Halo related(Adam was a huge fan), or any other number of small insignificant things that vaguely remind if them I get in a terrible mood. I've lost days of sleep to that, sometimes a few in a row.&amp;#x200B;I've convinced myself that the only way to get closure to any of this is to hurt them, and since I've been alone with my thoughts for a while hurt has turned into considering murder. I think I'd actually do it if anything else traumatic happens in my life, like I'd just become dead to how others feel. I would not care about the consequences. I've already convinced myself that my death would be a little consequence, it would save money, and my family is emotionally distant. The only things stopping me is the well-being of my dog, who's 17, and funnily enough The Last of Us 2. I had a therapist but like I said, I can't trust people. But I am on depression medication.&amp;#x200B;Advice? Questions? Thoughts? I may not take it well, but shoot anyway. I just want to be happy again. Thanks",1
900,"I hate myself so much that it spreads around me at times : Hi,Before I begin, I am sorry for my language skills, it isn't my native tongue and I am not the best writer. This is the first time I express myself. I have nobody else but here.  In my country at schools retakes are once a year at the end of academic semesters where one retake can make you pass or fail the whole year. Until university I always slacked around and was practicing programming. At the end of each academic year I would attend all retakes and pass with C or above. However, we had those meetings where teachers would give feedback about us to our parents. And teachers always said ""Kuzenet is very kind and quiet. He is a nice boy, maybe the nicest in the class but he doesn't study at all."" These words would render my mother super angry. Every time she is back from those meetings I would get yelled at and my mother would cry every time. I am very sensitive and it was very damaging for me. Not to mention i did get beaten up a couple of times due to my mother's anger. My father would make his grumpy face - i would rather prefer someone torturing me instead of seeing him like that for months. He would never talk to me with a happy and welcoming tone. I could tell he wants me to go away as soon as possible his sentence is over from his tone. By the time my parents get better, another meeting would happen and all would reset. This loop begun in primary school until the end of high school.  The reason why I mention this is because, now I feel incredibly inferior although I got scholarship and a part time engineering job. I feel very stupid at work and at university as well. Especially because the fact that I started university a lot later than my peers. I have no friends, literally zero. People only text me when they need help with assignments or when they study for exams. People I helped gave me nice feedback all the time about how their grades improved thanks to my assistance and all. No friends from that either. I pick foods that don't damage your brain but I love chocolate and every time I eat chocolate I feel very guilty thinking the sugar will dampen my cognitive abilities once sugar levels go down. All I wanted was friends that I can listen to, text with, read their messages. My phone doesn't function well for the past year and I didn't get a new one because there is no use for it in my life.  I read a lot of suggestions online about going to rock climbing or something like that, but I am not into that and besides, I am living abroad. It is really hard to make any friends when you are a foreigner even if you are a fit in their culture just because you don't know the language that well. There is also the fact that some people don't like the country I came there from. They have assumptions about people from there and they avoid me at first. I do not put in the effort of proving them I am worth their time because I also don't think I am a great person either. I am only good at solving problems when people have one. Other than that, I don't know what to do.  This consistent anger at myself being stupid and incompetent makes me short tempered at my parents. When I visit them I get easily annoyed. Today I made my father upset, I am very afraid of losing my parents as I think as people age they can't endure sadness or stress well and each time they are upset, I get 10x more depressed at least. My hatred towards myself is just adding up. This ends up being a infinite loop.  I remember I was a very happy kid but nowadays nothing makes me happy. This has been going on for about 8 years. Everything is black and white. I attract no-one, I don't look into mirror for the past 8 years and I overthink everything.  I hate myself to the fullest and I can't forgive how many times I made my parents upset. I failed a business before starting university due to third-party conditions. It wasn't my fault but still, I am the one who caused a loss. While I am not considering suicide because I can't do that to my parents, I don't feel alive at all. I live to work, yet I fail at being successful.",1
901,"I just know this life isn't for me, and I want to step out of it : I've been struggling really bad with depression, anxiety and an eating disorder these past 3 years and a few months back I asked myself for the first time âWhy?â?Why am I going through hell and back if it's just to get better and be pushed into a society I don't want to be a part of. I've always struggled with going to school, learning etc, always wanted to stay home sick, crying if I had to go. Not because I was being bullied but because I truly felt like it was sucking my soul away. Ofcourse when I tell this to psychologists they tell me that it's the depression talking and that I'll find something that will make me happy, but in my heart of hearts I know that I won't be happy living the 9-5 job, starting a family and just doing what everyone expects you to. So lately suicidal thoughts have just been at an all-time high with the only thing stopping me being afraid of the pain that comes with it.

The few weeks before break, I'd go home early nearly every day because it's so god damn hard to keep going forward. But holy fuck am I sick of it I just want a bullet in my god damn head because I feel as if I go to work tomorrow, I may kill a motherfucker. I don't want to lose my job, I want my family to stop suffering, I want to get better but this world makes it so fucking hard.",1
904,"I get irritated very easily. How can I stop being a snowflake? : I don't know why but I'm getting so easily susceptible to irritation. I feel frightened of going outside and interacting with people, for every time someone treats me badly or rudely I will feel so sad and down and annoyed for such an extended period of time. I also feel frightened of reading news online for I will feel so down when I read any bad news. I'm now such a snowflake having a fragile and vulnerable heart. It seems the only way to prevent me being hurt is to completely isolate myself from the outside world... I really hate my personality and want to get rid of that!",1
905,"Feeling so alone this holiday... : I have spend it with next to no contact; no family, no friends, no supportive figures in my life. I'm trying to cope with everything, but it's really starting to get to me. I've broken down crying nearly every day since the start of the holidays. Maybe I've been too ungrateful, I know my friends(current roommates) have done so much for me... but I've communicated over and over and over about my mental illnesses and what I'm working and what my needs are. That doesn't matter to them I feel like, nothing changes.. they've helped me financially with things like replacing my bed with a smaller one to fit my room, and not starving to death, and even did some laundry for me because of my financial situation... but i told them I couldn't cope with the amount of messes they leave everywhere, and if I so much as leave a small one then I'm in the wrong.. I just wanted to get my education completed and get better with my mental illnesses but everything keeps going wrong and now they're feeling like I'm using them so they're refusing to help me with food, and going so far as to ask me for money when they offer me things like a glass of wine. It's emotionally killing me inside. I'm not against helping in the house but... they make it so unbearable. They're so excruciatingly lazy and they expected me to clean up after them. ""You're not doing anything right now so you can clean it"" was their reasoning...  I don't know if I'm being selfish and disrespectful.. I'm not trying to be, I just can't handle this much. I'm starving(not currently since I bought a little food), panicked about my future, insecure and hopeless nd not even my bf is here right now to keep me from sinking into a pit of despair. This has been the most painful christmas of my life.. I don't even know if there's a point in fighting anymore. I don't see things getting better and it's scaring me. I might really starve to death if I don't get some financial stability soon, but it's hard to work with my bpd,ptsd, adhd, ocd, gad, sad all untreated.. next to no money to make myself presentable, and incomplete education..  I really don't know what to do to make this better... I just really need a tight hug to cope with all this pressure. I wouldn't be cracking so much if it weren't for the fact that I don't have anyone. I don't have anyone because of my unchecked mh, having burned all my bridges by acting so reckless. I just want this vicious cycle to stop...  I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a whine and complain.. I just.. I'm going crazy",1
906,"I've been laying here trying to remember anything good from 2019... There's nothing there... : Every day was the same - work, sit around the house, sleep, do chores... It all faded into one grey nothing besides the black that was August. Let's just say it was particularly rough because of some bad choices I made... Honestly, 2019 was probably the worst year of my life. It's even worse thinking this year won't be any different.Everyone's always hyped with their resolutions and goals, and I know most people would just say to do it âbecause it'll make you feel betterâ? but what if I just simply don't care? Or don't have the motivation to? Why should I make goals or try to change when inevitably all I can really do is work my ass off for nothing just to survive? Isn't that all life is anyway? Working to survive? How can you possibly âliveâ?when responsibilities and the dark emptiness of adulthood hang over you like the cutting edge of a knife? How could I possibly âchangeâ?when every time I think I've taken a single step forward, I get knocked back ten feet?I'm so tired. I don't want to fight anymore. All I can see in my future is the same pain and misery that's been filling my life since high school. The only reason I'm alive is because I don't want to leave my pain with anyone else.

I'm approaching my 30s, I'm in a stable relationship, but I feel ugly and unwanted and I might not be able to have kids so that makes me feel like I am just entirely worthless as a woman.

I've had a struggling relationship with exercise for about a year and it was always because I lacked motivation. It's a cycle really;I start working out for a few days, then stop suddenly and feel like shit the entire time until I work out again, which usually takes months.I spent December shoveling food in my face and smoking pot because fuck it, and I had enough of being weak and feeling like shit psychically. But no, I couldn't even lift up the weight and do a proper technique for even 5 seconds. And you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna leave all the equipment there because I'm too lazy, hit âpostâ?eventually, do a bong hit (and not even get that high bc of my shit mental state) and go to sleep. I'm gonna wake up, and continue to partake in my unhealthy habits until I'm dead. I'm only 18, and this only one of the many viscous cycles that are in my life. Currently bawling out of frustration.

923,"3 weeks on mirtazapine 7.5 mg pros, cons and questions. : I was prescribed this medication for depression and anxiety. Pros1. It has helped with the intrusive and existential thoughts. I don't spend hours stuck in a loops of bad thoughts anymore. It has helped me fall to sleep quicker. Cons1. My appetite was not the best before the medication but I was able to maintain weight. After taking it I have gained over 20 pounds in only almost 3 weeks. In 2017 I lost over 70 pounds in 3 month span from stomach issues (gastroparesis and IBS and stomach ulcers). I went from 205 to 135 dangerously fast almost needed a feeding tube. I used weed to cope with the nausea and appetite problems before this medication. It later was a factor in my depression sadly. 2. Even though it helps me sleep, I wake up at 11 am after sleeping close to 12 hours exhausted. I still feel the sedating affects from the medication. 3. Still hasn't changed my dull emotions or lack of emotions. I still can't genuinely laugh or smile (even while smoking weed). It just feels weird like I am in a haze. 4. My short term memory has gotten way worse while Taking the medication. I always have had a minor short term memory problem when I started smoking (go figure). Now after not smoking for a whole month I was diagnosed with a inattentive attention disorder. I almost feel like I am not Perceiving time normally. Days months and years go by to fast and have been for the past 3 years or so (I'm only 19).  I can't focus on anything and I stare off into space a lot. Which causes anxiety about my mind spiraling into the concept of time and how fast everything goes. I also have zero thoughts at all it's weird like it's hard for me to think of something. 5. It hasn't helped my anxiety at all. I still have social anxiety and fluctuations in heat rate which gets me more anxious because I have Bradycardia (35bpm for me normally). 6. I can hardly work out on this medication. I have no energy and get burnt out easy. post workout I could almost fall asleep. I would like to know if anyone has had similar medication experiences? And does anything actually change? I don't want to waste anymore of my life in a hole. I also don't want to waste time with a doctor giving me a cocktail of medications to make me feel like a total zombie. I'm only 3 weeks on meds but I have spend the last 3 years digging myself a hole with abusing cannabis. I also don't know wtf I want to do with my life. I am in fear of working for âthe manâ?to make his pockets bigger while I am just skimming by, clutching on the 2 days of freedom every week. I rather be in the mountains in a cabin fishing and going skiing. Honestly my depression stems from having the 1st taste of what the majority of people's âreal worldâ?is like.",1
924,"ive been contemplating taking my own life : and im posting this here because i know i dont have the nuts to go through with it. Im an eighteen year old who struggles with a circuit board of mental issues. life is so confusing and anxiety inducingWhen i was little, i wanted to grow up to be an animator, i loved watching shows and drawing, i found most of my creative output came in drawing. Last week, my portfolio was rejected. I had spent months, almost a year on my portfolio. Drawing, scrapping, crying, tearing, repeat. I had taken a few months to gather money for college, and i havent had the heart to tell my mom i didnt get in. I havent told my mom things in a long time, and i lie to her about my mental health. The amount of times ive held a knife and contemplated just slitting my throat open or holding all my night medication and downing it in one go before going to sleep shocks me sometimes. Its almost a daily thing, an hourly thing. With every action i do i think of a way to off myself on the spot. And the only thing keeping me from doing it is the time i told my dad i was having suicidal thoughts, and he broke down crying saying he is afraid to come home one day from work to find his youngest daughter dead. And that he couldve been home to prevent it.And when in 2013, when my cousins died in a plane crash, my mom was devastated, she wouldnt stop crying, my dad had to restrain her, and i just started crying because i was so confused. Those are her niece and nephew but what about her Daughter? I may not get along with my mom, but i still love her too much to put her through that pain.

932,"Decline, Hope, Jealousy and idc what else : I have been a high functioning depressed person for a long time. Got into special programs, went to class for gifted kids in what is pretty much the best school in my country, and what else. I was born into an upper middle class family. Naturally athletic, pretty charismatic and good at socializing, and not particularly bad looking. Essentially, I was lucky and nothing else. Never had to work for anything. I was a smart and sharp kid, way above average. But the public education system doesn't suit everybody, and if it doesn't suit you, you get fucked. Bam, Zero learning skills and super lazy because i never had  to work for shit. Social skills got dunked on because a teacher said something that stuck with for a long time (not their fault, they were absolutely correct)So here. finished with elementary school, now entering middle school. Gifted class yada yada. It hits me like a truck. I've had minor depression before hand, but here it starts to really show up.  grades start to decline.  Parents who were used to nothing less than 95s punish me and yell at me, and that takes me down even farther. Later on they understand, but it's too late. The years go by and the depression gets worse ever so slightly as i go on. I get into a luxurious govt program. Puts me under a whole lot of stress since, you know, no learning skills and super lazy. I also get diagnosed with ADD around this time so i get some much needed help for that (but sadly the pills only worsen my depression). I keep going, and get into highschool. It's bad. i leave the program halfway through the year, and also move from electrics course to CS. fast forward, and I leave the physics course and i still haven't caught up to my class in CS because as i said, I'm lazy. &amp;#x200B;by now depression is running wild and i am no longer high functioning.  I no longer shower everyday, i eat less and less, my mind is less sharp and my memory isn't what it used to be. The only reason i wake up is because I'm used to it and because i know i'll get yelled at or punished if i so much as say i don't want to go to school. Doing things i enjoy is getting harder, since I either don't have the energy to them or because my parents take them away because I have depression. Life is pain. I can't function, I don't want to function, and I don't want to be able/want to function.&amp;#x200B;I had dreams. A future people promised me. Gone. It's not achievable. And it fucking HURTS. Sometimes I gain hopes, but they're shut down so quickly by life.&amp;#x200B;I have never been able to bring myself to hurt myself.  Tried. A lot. Could never actually get it done. I get jealous when I see posts about people who did because i know that's the only way my parents will believe i have depression. A therapist already confirmed it to them but that's not enough i guess. I hope I'll hurt them a lot if and when I actually kill myself&amp;#x200B;I don't want any ""it gets better"" or bullcrap like that. &amp;#x200B;i just want to be recognized",1

I can even go to family gathering anymore cause everyone's tired of my dramatic depression. I don't even complain about it when I'm out. I just speak and everyone gets angry at me. I spent new year's Eve alone trying to drink myself to death. I just recently quit my job cause I don't wanna work anymore. I feel like it's coming to an end very soon and I'm honestly kinda happy when I think about it. Seriously, what's the point in getting old? What's the point in having a career?

934,"I've rationalized suicide : A little about me first. I'm a 25 year old male. I grew up an orphan and don't know my parents. I've grew up with a couple of different foster parents and have been abused by one of them. I have no friends, no SO, no people I can talk to and spend most of my time at home feeling incredibly lonely. On top of that I hate my job so both my work life as well as my free time is spent feeling worthless. I am incredibly ugly (this is not self-warped image, the foster parents i stayed with the longest have told me this repeatedly and also my previous friends and one of my exes have told me this). Furthermore I have incredibly bad social skills, depression and social anxiety so making new friends is not really something that i can just do. I take drugs to cope but they don't really work and make me feel empty and useless. I have contact with my fostermom (foster dad left her) but she has several mental illnesses which make me going to her a chore and I try my best to be there for her but it's incredibly one sided. She often shows me her cut marks and I have to hide the fact that I have these feelings because I want to be there for her. So not really a healthy contact. Besides this I view the world, as well as life as quite negative in its all and think a lot of people are massive dickheads and life isn't worth living. Or at least not for me.So, I'm in a really bad spot at the moment and have actively rationalized me killing myself. I think suicide is the most logical option for me and there is no way around it. The way I view it you could have a good life if the â'good'â?(and what this means is different for everybody) in your life outweighs the bad, and you have a bad life if the â'bad'â?in your life (and what bad means is different for everybody) outweighs the good. Death seems to be the absolute middlepoint between those two since its the absence of both. Is it then not more logical for me to kill myself then to keep on living? I understand that this is a gamble, it can better. But then again, it might not get better, so its a gamble either way. With my past in the back of my mind I think it's safer gambling on dying and let everything end then to gamble on keeping on living and hoping that things will change. Don't get me wrong, I used to have hope, lots of it! But I feel like keeping on hoping is just denying reality and setting myself up for dissapointment I just got off the phone with a suicide hotline and she basically told me that I'm philosophising too much and that she couldn't help me in that way. So i really hope some people have some advice for me, I want to think differently, I don't know why, maybe its just the survival bias in me. But everytime I think about it I feel like there is no reason to think differently and thinking that suicide is the most logical option.Some advice that I think won't help in my case:â'Go and travel'â? I did this already, three times. I've never felt more lonely then those times.âWhat about your loved onesâ? Besides the fact that I think this is bad advice because it just tells someone to live for others, I don't have them. Literally. I have some collegues who might be a bit saddened but nothing so bad that it would convince me to keep on living.âMaybe there is an afterlive and who says that isn't worse then this lifeâ? If thats the case then keeping on living is just procrastinating and I will end up there eventually regardless. I'll gladly take that gamble.âHave you talked to a professional about your problemsâ? Yes, I'm with my 4th psychologist. It doesn't help sadly.âTry to get hobbiesâ? I have them, I enjoy them to a point. But they don't outweigh the bad.""Go out, make friends, meet people"": tried it already, a lot of times. This has gotten way longer then I planned. If you've read all the way to this point ur awesome &lt;3 (Not if u just skipped to the last sentence though, ur not awesome at all).",1

938,"What helps me just some ideas : I've had a long period of depression where I didn't know what to do with myself. What helps me is I would pick a random task didn't matter what it was I would just do it, for example I would do something small like I would look at my room when I woke up and I would think of turning on the TV as a mini success story like oh great I accomplished that I wanted to do. The next thing is like picking a show and sometimes that can be hard to do I find that when I'm in a depressed state I tend to watch the same shows over and over because there are no surprises, but generally change helps with depression. So what I will do is I will just scroll down with my eyes closed and then choose whatever show I land on and just start watching it. Even though it may not seem like much to just sit and watch a show I'd like to look at it as an accomplishment. And the next thing I do I feel motivated to do so turning n the TV is a very simple thing but you did it and now you're experiencing something new. If that's not your thing then try other things that make you smile or laugh for example dancing is a big thing for me I normally do it on Tik Tok as cringey as that may sound but it's something I love to do. So I'll find a song I'll pick the song which makes me feel great because I'm jamming along to it and I'm rocking back and forth and bobbing my head. I then play out some moves and that makes me feel good I have something I'm working on the idea of getting something done is generally a feel-good type of feeling especially when it's something you like to do and then I start recording and I just kind of do whatever eventually have formed this creation that I have and I can be proud of something that I did and the feeling is just beautiful. It has helped me a lot from any dangerous situations where I thought about just not living anymore but those little things they tend to add up even if it's just waking up and making your bed or fluffing a pillow or taking your medicine even. Whatever the case set a task for yourself you kind of feel accomplished in a way. I just kind of wanted to put my thoughts out there venting also helps obviously lol",1

941,"I have to go back on a higher dose and I hate admitting it : A couple months ago, I talked with my doctor about going on a lower dose of my antidepressant because it was affecting my memory and sleep (so we thought)My wife and I made jokes that I was on such a high dosage, I was basically on horse tranquilizers.  Two months ago, I went on a lower dose and everything was fine.  I just took less and didn't feel worse or better.  Maybe a little less sluggish and my memory was a bit better (I had troubles remembering some stuff).  The last two months have been great except for the last couple weeks.  It started with more worry.  I started thinking and stressing about is everything okay?  Is my relationship in a good place?  Is my wife happy?  Am I doing everything I can at work?  Why can't I do better in general?I shrugged it off just being regular stresses and took this holiday season to just relax and enjoy.  It was going fine, but still I had nagging stresses and felt myself going into a bigger and bigger hole every time something not ideal happened.  I would be down for hours afterwards and I wasn't about to admit to myself or my wife that I wasn't doing well.   I pushed so hard to be okay that a couple days ago, something very trivial happened where I took it to heart and a few days later, it was all I could think about when I was about to go to sleep, going to the movies, with friends or family.  I've come to the conclusion that I need to go back up a little on my dosage like I was before.  My depression is back.  My doctor said if I started feeling it, I should go back up to the old dosage. (1/2 a pill instead of a 1/3)  I feel like a failure.  My depression is still there and I can't beat it without medication.My sleep is still the same on both dosages.  My memory will get worse possibly.  Maybe my methods I've built in remembering will help and I can not fall back into forgetting things.But I'd rather be forgetful than frustrated, sad, angry, and overall unpleasant to be with the past couple weeks.  I'm not suicidal at all, I'm not wanting to harm myself, I'm just sad and it's affecting my overall happiness in life and it's causing strain on my relationships.I'm waiting for my wife to come home to talk to her about it and I know she's going to be supportive, but I'm in such a hole that I feel like she won't be.  I'm so in my head.  Can I get some support?  P.S.  If I do show my wife this, and now she's reading this, I'm sorry for the past couple weeks of shit.  I love you and my depression is no indicator how happy and in love I am with you.  You are my best friend and you didn't do anything wrong.  I know this is hard for you to fully understand, so, thank you for your love and support always :)",1
942,"depressed ex sending weird signals : So after a month from breaking up and a week of not contacting each other after I ghosted her boring message,  I texted my ex telling her I cared and if she ever needed or wanted to talk to feel free to reach out. She replied with a âyeah well you tooâ?I didn't reply. Later in the day she sent me a Snapchat telling me she was drunk (New Years eve) nothing else interesting though. I was like yay have fun, and we didn't talk the rest of the night (she's in Europe rn I'm in the states). I didn't send her a happy New Years or anything when it turned midnight here. In the morning I woke up to a âhappy New Years, and all the best for you! ð¥°â?i replied with a âthanks and you tooâ? No other text communication although I replied to her snapchats about her dog being her love and her watching tv. I'm confusing because she broke up with me, she was heavily depressed and said couldn't feel anything, and later said she couldn't love me or anyone else right now. I find it kind of weird she'd include the lovey emoji, she doesn't use them much and it's just something I feel an ex wouldn't send to someone they broke up with. She's also been a little passive aggressive, likely she was mad I ghosted her (understandable) and has never been the type to double text or contact first. Any thoughts? I'm not desperate to get back together, I know maybe she's just trying to be nice and be friends (I'm not interested in a platonic friendship, I'll be nice and talk sometimes but I'm not going to be friendzoned) but I feel like the emoji is just a subtle hint or something.",1

I'm 23, so I have no business having a baby i can't care for properly, but my feelings are still real, dammit.Anyway I go onto a pregnancy support forum (which also claims to support women wanting to get pregnant) and was honest about my irrational envy. Hell, you might be able to still see the post yourself, idk.Anyway, it got deleted this morning. I got 3/5 nice comments sympathizing and reminding me it's gonna be okay (thank you, to those sweethearts &lt;3) and then two women in their 30's coming in and telling me I'm stupid and immature and ""wanting a family as a band-aid"" and blahblahblah.Anyway, the takeaway is that I can't talk about what contributes to my emotional suffering, and that I'm a bad person for feeling the way I do.

950,"I think I can't be happy without a relationship, and I can't get into a relationship. : everything just feels fucking empty. The only things that feel bearable to me are working, studying, and going to the gym, because those three things *might* be increasing the chance that one day I'll have a girlfriend who makes me as happy as my last did.Despite all the effort I put in, I feel hopeless. I know there's a non-zero chance that I'll get what I want - frankly that's the only thing that has kept me going since we broke up a year ago - but it seems so unlikely. I'm fucking trash, socially. I can't hold a conversation to save my life. I don't have the mental wherewithal to force myself into social situations to get any better.And I look like shit. Despite successfully dieting and exercising for the past 5 years, I just can't escape my shitty pear-shaped body. I was morbidly obese for my entire childhood, up until age 18, and my proportions are just permanently fucked up from that. Even at 5'10 and 139 lbs, I still had visible lovehandles, a sagging stomach, and oversized thighs. And I'm going bald in the worst fucking way possible. I'm 24 and my hairline hasn't receded, but my hair has thinned to the point of being completely see-through on the entire top of my head. I worked and lived at home for 6 months to save up $30,000 to go to the best hair transplant surgeon I could find, at which point I found out that I'm losing too much hair to be a viable candidate. I tried shaving my head, and that just made it worse - I couldn't stand to look at myself.and I feel like I deserve this, for being such a superficial piece of shit. I have a good job, I make a lot of money, and I take care of myself - Realistically, I know I could end up with a girlfriend. Plenty of boring, ugly guys are in happy relationships. But I can't settle. I tried. At 22, having never even kissed a girl, I said fuck it and dated a girl I wasn't especially physically attracted to, thinking that maybe it would happen if I opened myself up to the possibility. After three months, nothing had changed, and I had to break up with her. Shortly after, I met a girl I was **actually** crazy about, asked her out expecting nothing, and we wound up being in a relationship for about a year.being with her was the only time since childhood that I felt truly happy and comfortable with myself. I didn't care that I never had anything to say to anyone, or that I didn't have the body I wanted - I had a girlfriend, and that was all I needed. And I could say ""well if she was attracted to me, then surely another girl like her - who I would like as much as her - could also be attracted to me too,"" but it isn't that simple. She didn't know I was losing my hair. I wore a special dust you can put into thinning hair to make it look thicker; Basically, make-up. For the entire year we were together, I made sure that I always had it in when I was in her presence.And even putting the hair make-up stuff aside, I simply don't think I'll have a chance to meet anyone, even if they're out there. Because of the first paragraph of this post. Everything feels empty. Everything feels like shit. I don't do anything besides work, study, and exercise, and I don't **want** to do anything else.

Both my parents have said that I am a failure and my mom just straight up said to my grandmother that ""It's a disgrace I was born in this family. "" And they said all this because I got above average or actually pretty good marks in some very important exam. I actually worked quite hard for it and after the exams were over I took a break of 2 months from the studies. Maybe they said all that bad stuff cause they were angry but it's too late now. The thing that hurts me the most is that neither of them have still said ""You did good. "" Infact other family relatives have said that.

For me it's real it's my existence it's all I inevitably feel. :( my first trip was so amazing at first but so reality next. It's not just negative thinking its REAL feelings, that I know in my heart is true because it is true. I had so much fantasy that I imagined to make life lovable and tolerable. Now it's just fear that stops me from escaping my fate. I was so hoping for help and guidance. :( I'm just going to seek escape where I can and just accept it.

971,"I don't want to rely on my partner to get me out of my downward spirals : 2019 helped me get to a place where I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. This is after around 15 years of random behaviour such as break downs, outbursts, relationships ending because I never felt good enough, confusion of why my behaviour was so up and down etc. Leaving home so young I always took care of myself and others, and that was all I had really - this empathetic, 'over kindness' so that I knew I was good at something.I have a wonderful relationship now however am concerned my partner is the one to help me get out of my spirals. When I spiral I'm suicidal and get scared it's him that helps me crawl out of them. The next day I'm fine but then the guilt sets in at what he's had to watch me overcome and spend his effort on in helping me.Is this something others are used to?

That voice that starts pushing pushing pushing me to do something that I know I shouldn't.So I do little things to appease that voice.Deleting characters in games I play. Deleting posts that caused the trigger in the first place.It's worst when all i was trying to do was share something, trying to empathise, trying to grow, but to get slapped down, to be rejected... hurts and that hurt triggers the darkness.I'm trying my best, but it gets fucking harsh when all I seem to get is slapped down.No, that's not right.No, you don't get to say that.No, you don't matter.It's worse when I'm alone at night.

I don't know where to start and even if I should post this here,  I'm from Czech Republic, so my english isn't that good,  don't know exactly what to type, so here's the rant:I'm 16, M, I have Asperger's with selective mutism, anxiety and constant depressive episodes. I am struggling with school, my family and myself. I go to a grammar school (sixth year), because it's close by in another town (I live in a village, about 800 ppl). I really struggle with math, physics, chemistry, and biology. I just can't seem to understand numbers and formulae. Due to the anxiety and selective mutism, I can't even talk to teachers, I just ...freeze. Don't know quite how to explain it. I have an ""assisstant"" who is (sometimes) present during class that basically watches over me and talks to the adults, so that I ""don't have to"".  I feel really miserable because of me being unable to even frickin' talk.Basically everyone in my family has some health problems. They are good people and I am so sorry for them.  My father has very serious health problems and a big part in everything that happened to him plays stress.  He has to balance worrying about himself, me and the well-being of his firm.And then there's me.  I hate myself for everything I do. I sometimes even hate myself, when I remember that I hated myself in the past.  I am a really unstable person, I just lose control over myself when my anxiety kicks in or something bad happens, anything, no matter how small. When something happens, It's fight or flight. I usually just slam the desk or something, or run to my bed crying, if there's nobody around.  Been depressed for a couple of years now. Attempted suicide like 2 years ago. Stopped taking antidepressants because my psychiatrist told me to stop, because they didn't work. Got harassed by my previous psychiatrist, he wanted to put me inside of an asylum (""Just to observe"") on the first meeting, etc., he's been fired, because apparently he can't just do that, and he was harassing a lot of kids, it was in the news, I basically stopped trusting people after that experience.Stopped cutting myself 2 years ago, still think about suicide at times. I'm very sensitive to emotions and loud noises, I just want to die when someone yells at me or even slightly raises their voice. I don't know what to do in my life. I can't seem to get anything right. Not many things interest me. I can't put myself ""out there"". I can't even talk to most people. I feel bad for everyone that has to interact with me on a daily basis. I'm such a burden on everyone. I don't know what to do.  I just feel like my life doesn't have any purpose.

It was a senseless, shocking death. Here is the problem: her grieving is through her faith. She believes (or tries to believe) her sister is in Heaven.I am agnostic. I do not struggle with my views, and i do not believe in Heaven. I cannot in good conscience reinforce my gf's beliefs that her sister is in Heaven, because I sincerely don't believe that.I always listen to her. I hug and kiss her. I let her cry in my shoulder. She calls me at work just to hear my voice and I always answer. I wrap myself around her in bed so she has warmth to sleep next to. I encourage her to be the best she can be, because that is what her sis would want. I do my best to make her giggle and laugh, when appropriate. Her emotions are a rollercoaster.I am doing my best but i am not able to reinforce her faith and further her relationship with God. She has told me this, and we have discussed our religious differences a lot.What else can i do? I haven't experienced similar loss. My parents both have lost siblings and i was thinking i could get them closer to her? My folks believe in God, but not heaven (Sikhism).I am aware religious differences usually end relationships, but that is not the purpose of this post. ââââ?tl;dr my religious gf believes her sister is in Heaven and i cannot share that belief.

My reminiscing is cut short by a 5 year old girl bursting into my room with a smile on her face. Felicity. My baby sister is one of the few reasons I get up in the morning. And to see the familiar, and chubby face brought me nothing but what I guess was joy. It is now time for me to put on the mask. I've learned many things about depression in the past 3 years. One of those things is to never grant anybody access to my emotions. The trauma, and pain I have experienced from the hospitals I've been subjected to, are second to none. Absolute agony. So I wear a metaphorical mask, one of energy, and joy.  I walk down the carpet stairs whilst holding Felicity's hand, and I am instantly greeted with the expectations for the day. Today I must play with Felicity, clean my room, do my laundry, clean my bathroom, clean the kitchen, and keep myself from killing myself, or getting high. I also cannot talk to either of my parents about how I'm doing, because I'd be bothering them. I don't do most of these things. I simply take my medicine, and watch my humanity, and emotions slip away with a gulp. I do this everyday. I fall asleep as the medicine kicks in, and takes my energy. I do this everyday. I eat. And eat, and eat, and eat, until I feel like throwing up. I do nothing with my life. The only thing I do is listen to music. I love music. I truly adore all kinds of it. I love learning about music. I love listening to music. I play 4 instruments, and produce music. But I don't anymore Depression has taken away my future. I don't have the drive to create music. So I just sit. I sit. I eat, I sleep, and I do it all again. I'm so alone, I'm so sad. I'm so empty.Not quite sure what this post is, but I feel like shit, and don't want to live like this anymore.

I'm just venting about stuff so if it's boring or anything you don't have to read it, that's fine.I've been on antidepressants for a while now, almost approaching the 6 month mark. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety most of my life, and only sought out medical help and counselling recently after a period of consideration.But they don't work. The medication just doesn't work. Counselling didn't work either. I have a private social media that I vent on which helps with my anxiety and occasional angry outbursts, but even they are starting to feel less helpful. I just feel dead. My family don't feel like my family, I have no emotion towards them whatsoever, and I spent the holidays quietly keeping out of everyone's way. Self harming is a thing which I've been doing since I was around 15-16. I have gotten over it from time to time, but the last 3 months have been hell for it.I'm losing interest in everything I used to love. Gaming was a big escape for me, especially fantasy, and now Gaming is almost a distant memory for me. I lose interest almost straight after I start a game up, and I just end up laying on my bed instead, either sleeping the day away or just staring into space. It's not fun. I'm a university student so I was expecting a lack of free time to do stuff like gaming so that's understandable, but I've had loads of free time. I've been pushing myself to be a more hardworking student, and it's paid off in some respect, since it frees up my weekends usually. But still I don't want to do anything. I say hardworking, but finding the motivation to do my work is something that comes once in a blue moon. I've spent countless all nighters at my university trying to get work done in tiny amounts. My attendance is fine but I get the impression I'm being judged for my actions.The other issue I've noticed is that I've stopped eating properly. I'm capable of cooking the basics, trust me. But I have no appetite. I've become noticeably thinner and when people comment on it or worry about how skinny I am I just shrug it off. I don't like the thought of my friends and peers noticing how bad I'm getting. I think I've ranted enough here, I apologize for the massive wall of text, thanks for reading this though.",1

1020,"Do people just fake being excited? : Recently there was Christmas and yesterday there was New Year's Eve. I don't know about other people but me personally, there wasn't a moment when I felt exited about my presents (even though I got actually good ones) or when we entered 2020. I just felt numb, people seemed to be happy/excited and all so I just went along with it and put on a fake smile, said thank you for the presents to be polite and during New Year's Eve people shouted Â«Â Happy new year!Â Â» with a big smile on their face, they seemed genuinely happy and I didn't want to ruin the moment so I smiled and said it back but in reality I couldn't give less shit about starting a new year. I just... felt numb. Empty. As if it was just another normal day except the food for dinner was quite nice. I honestly would've rather get a good night sleep than stay up until 3am. So here's my question: do people fake being excited during such events?",1
1021,"I'm so lonely and nobody's favorite : Last night (New Year's Eve) was somehow one of the best and worst night's of my life. New Year's Eve going into 2019 and 2020 have both been spent alone. For the second year in a row, my friends didn't invite me to hang out. With around 3 hours to go until midnight, I checked social media and (to absolutely no surprise) see them all in a picture holding up champagne glasses together. I don't know what hurt me more. Seeing them together without me, or the fact that I wasn't even relatively surprised. They pull this shit all the time. So, I said ""fuck them"" to myself, got in a discord call with my internet friends (who presumably were also lonely) and had a blast playing video games until 3am. That made me really happy, but still in the back of my mind the whole night was my ""friends"" together without me. It's not just holiday parties they don't invite me to, but literally every time they go to the mall or go to one of their houses. Im not even exaggerating when I say they've never invited me anywhere. And these are the people I've been best friends with since fucking 7th grade. We sit together everyday at lunch. I don't think they don't invite me because they don't like or want me to be there, I think its because (for some reason) they think I wouldn't want to go, which is so far from the truth. I don't really understand. I have a pretty big fear of missing out so this really scares me a lot. I'm probably that one person the friend group that everyone kinda forgets about when they're not with them. Which leads me to my second point. I'm literally nobody's favorite. Nobody thinks ""Oh! Im so exited to see meorahh today!"" or nobody gets exited at the mention of my voice. Im just kinda of... here. If the did think of me, maybe I would be invited to things. And I know people will say, ""Just make new friends!"" but that's not how it works. I can't just make new friends because its not that easy. Trust me, if it was i would've made new friends a long time ago. Anyways... thanks for reading",1
1022,"Why is it that talking to people about depression is so hard? : Heyo everyone. I'm usually a chipper person outwardly in my day-to-day life. It's all a facade, of course, but I feel like a lot of folks with depression do the same. I'm constantly telling people to be positive, giving career advice, and overall trying to be a decent person for my wife, kids, and co-workers (not my friends, as I have literally none since I graduated college).Keeping with that, why do I have such a problem talking to my wife about my depression? I feel stupid for complaining about my anxiety over money, debt, and bills. I feel like I'm just bitching when I complain about having to work from home because of a sleep disorder I have. I know I'm a hypocrite when I say ""I need to lose weight"" and then just have absolutely no motivation to actually do it. I whinge about how much my job makes me want to just kill myself but then stick with it because ""It pays the bills."" I just make excuses for everything and whinge about everything which leads to me just trying to keep it inside instead. My doctor told me the other day that my sleep apnea (not the disorder I mentioned, that's another one) is extremely severe because I'm so overweight; why don't I just lose the weight? I couldn't bring myself to answer with ""because I'm an unmotivated fat fuck that values my life less than I value the brief happiness I get from drinking soda.""It's behaviour that we know is self-destructive and I don't want to think I'm the only person that keeps everything bottled up. It leads to days where I'm just really on edge and I feel like even more of a burden than I usually do. The only reason I keep going is because my family needs me for money at this point.I just wanted a forum where I could whine some without being judged too harshly. Cheers.",1

1024,"Warning: semi-explicit: Sexuality. Not Ready for Sex... Normal? : I'm 19, straight had semi- sexual experiences with guys. 1) I don't know if I like kissing or not. I've kissed 4 different guys now all relatively recently too and didn't get much...any pleasure really from the actual kissing. Maybe that's chemistry or maybe I just don't really like kissing. I kinda don't mind it tho, and actually really like making out but not really because of the kissing but because it's intimate and hot and fun idk lol. ALSO I feel like I'm way behind with everyone my age not being ready for sex and all but I really think it's connected to my mental health (me being mild/moderately depressed like 24/7 all the time everyday, mainly everything is somewhat dissatisfying, nothing completely fulfilling). Am I just not ready or is it me being inhibited bc of my mental health? Me not wanting to because no one's ever made me orgasm except myself (and I'm not even sure I've done it before) and I definitely don't orgasm most of the time that I masterbate which is also rare and I don't try to explore much cz I'm depressed, lazy, only have desire to do it like 1-2 times a month. I feel like maybe I have a more difficult vag haven't tried like any toys besides a tiny cheap bullet vibrator which did absolutely nothing for me, inside or on my clit. Am I just not ready for sex cz want it to be with someone meaningful (fulfilling) and that will make me feel ready as well as not being depressed so things will actually be satisfying? Or maybe I just have to learn how to actually get pleasure down there and then I'll want to do more. Idk what's normal and what's not. Turned down sex (and blow jobs, no desire to do that or even TRY it at all) (not willing to try many new things cz of my depression) multiple times cz just no desire to really go for it, do it.",1

1033,"Just passing time : I just turned 35 and for a long time I've dealt with depression. I had a abusive childhood and alot of abandonment issues stemming from my mom. Growing up around drugs and all around bad environment. Bouncing from place to place. The one steady thing I felt I had to turn to was my dad. He passed away about 9 years ago from a pill addiction. Before he passed away I adopted my first real pet (dog) that helped me with my depression. A few years I got another dog and things where ok. Still dealt with depression but not as bad. In March of 2019 my first dog passed away. I felt completely lost and my depression came back ten fold. Then my current girlfriend of 3yrs told me she was pregnant. During this time we didnt live together. She kept wanting me to move in with her and her 2 boys. Which I did. My whole life changed. Now she had the baby, and my other dog is getting aggressive and acting out. So we fight about the dog all the time which is making my depression worse and my anxiety through the roof. She knows I won't get rid of the dog because it helps my depression. I wanna be there for my baby but I cant see fighting with my girlfriend every day. But it's to a point where I think about suicide on a daily basis. If I knew I could do it right and not feel anything I would go through with it. So until  I move out with the dog or give her up I'm just here passing time.. just dont know why I'm even here.",1

1036,"I've never felt so down or broken before. I really hate life. : I really miss my parents. My dad died almost 26 years ago when I was 13. I loved hanging out with him at work. He showed me so much. Every young person needs a dad like him. It was so devastating when he died. The doctors kept telling me he was going to be alright. I was just a kid. I didn't know better. It blind sided me when he died. My mom slipped into a deep depression. A couple of years after that she walked out on me. I lived a long time alone before I reconnected with her. I can remember my friends getting birthday presents, being with family at Thanksgiving. It was an insane feeling getting used to just being alone. There were a few girlfriends but nothing serious. It's proven impossible to find a woman that will love me. &amp;#x200B;The last year of my mom's life I was dating what I thought was the love of my life. When my mom got sick and was hospitalized I needed someone to talk to. I called my girlfriend at the time but she wouldn't pick up her phone. Didn't respond to texts. It didn't take long to figure out she was cheating on me. It was a crazy situation. She was messing around with a married guy and the guy's wife spray panted my now exgirlfriend's car. Police were calling and there was a lot to deal with. Shortly after my mom died I received an audio file. Someone recorded my ex-girlfriend talking on the phone with someone about how she didn't want to deal with me and my mom's death. That she didn't have the time and better things to do. It was unbelievable how cold. I buried my mother alone. The time I should have been spending with my mom I was talking to the police until they figured out who was harassing my exgirlfriend. She destroyed the mourning time I should have had for my mother. This is something that I was carry with me for the rest of my life. This was a year and a half ago. I've been alone ever since. I've lost my sex drive and have nothing but contempt for dating. I've been in therapy but to be honest I don't think it working for me. I think this situation isn't what most therapists deal with. Someone that's been alone like I have and lost what I have probably isn't fixable. I got a text recently from my exgirlfriend. She was begging me to meet her somewhere so she could apologize. I blocked the new number she texted me from. I don't want to see or hear from her again. I have moments when I want to get out there and meet someone. I'll even go as far as to create a dating profile or go out where single people hang out. But when I look at women I just see this unreliable thing that's just going to hurt me. I'm just reminded of my failures in dating and how every girl that's been with me just wanted to find someone else with complete disregard to my feelings. It would be different if things just didn't work out. If I could get a ""Sorry but this isn't working for me"" speech. That you can't argue with. That you can get over. I've never felt this broken or sad. I feel like since she cheated on me while my mom was dying in the hospital then who can you trust? Now it's too late. When I needed someone the most they screwed me over. The world had it's chance to impress me with it's compassion but it showed me how horrible people can be instead.",1
1037,"I stay up all night, as if that will stop the next day from coming : The actual act of going to bed is something I dread in very dulled kind of way. Like that interval when you're lying in bed, the lights off, and you're *trying* (desperately) to sleep (which is a bit of contradiction in itself) - that's one of my least favourite moments of human experience. For me that's when the really horrible thoughts come from all sides, and time goes agonisingly slowly, and I'm just there tossing and turning, trying and failing to sleep for what feels like eternity, and it sucks big time. I very much dislike that shit. So what I do is - and it's not really a conscious decision, like it's just what happens, or what I let happen - is I stay up. Late. Real late. To the point where it becomes early. On one level to avoid that moment, so that I'll be so exhausted that I just drop, on another, so that I don't have to face the next day with all its inevitable tedium (a delusion). I whittle away the hours by distracting myself in various ways, like reading, writing, watching things, music, scrolling through reddit, scrolling mindlessly without actually looking at the posts, etc. Anything to not be alone with myself. Anyone else have similar experience? Maybe have some tips? I know I have a surrender problem, I can't let go or be still, and that I should start meditating as a regular practice, and that I need to start being with myself more and communicating with myself more, like starting a journal or something. And get back into regular exercise. And cut down on screen time. But idk, whenever I start doing these things, they quite quickly drop off. It's hard to make changes when you've felt shitty for so long, when you're more comfortable with feeling shitty than working to get better. The devil you know.",1

My life now is even better than it used to be before, I have a good career and I am away from abusive family. But things have only been getting worse and worse, and I don't have the courage to end my life, I am just stuck here and being tortured everyday. I am seeing both a therapist and a psychiatrist and both are not helping. medication is not fuckin helping either. The only thing that gives me any sort of momentary relief right now is talking to people who actually care, but I hate to keep bothering others with my shit, and I end up feeling more guilty to even ask for help because I feel so damn pathetic and weak. I truly have no idea what to do anymore and I believe that my brain is just way too damaged to keep going, but I can't fuckin kill myself because that would leave my family devastated. So it seems like I just have to keep on living for the sake of others as always, because as for me my life seems like it is already done and I do not have any passion for anything. in the past there used to be some things that I did that used to lift my mood up, now almost nothings works and I am constantly very depressed with no hope, no matter what I accomplish I can never be able to love myself, which is the reason why I think I am incapable of having a healthy relationship.

Either way, my adopted mom bought me a few books in relation to adoption to read when I was young. Where is said adopted mom now you ask? In another state, with her new husband, my older brother whom she manipulated into moving in with her, spending her days lying to all her friends about what a horrible daughter I am for abandoning her, about how her ex husband divorced her when it was the other way around, conveniently never discusses the money she steals from my dad every month,  believing she's âworthy of it because of the kids I raisedâ? and hasn't spoken to me in over a year because I blocked her after she straight up âforgotâ?to answer a phone call we scheduled to have! So yeah. Why should I look at a bunch of books all dedicated to to reminding me how much an adoptive family should love their child just as much as a birth child, when that was never the case for me? And when my adoptive father also has mental problems and a drinking problem but refuses to get help, and complains about how in debt he is and how bad his physical health is when he won't get any help for that either? Yeah he has to pay my mom a scathing amount every month, but still. He's admitted he doesn't wanna work because he's depressed but he won't get help for his depression. But still feels the need to say things like, âI don't know how much longer I can do any of this.â?And talk about losing is job and if he does will definitely lose our house. See, I don't get to talk about my problems. Cause I clearly don't have any. But everyone else sure as hell does!

I'm depressed, eat my feelings, hate how I look, eat more to make myself feel better. I'm TRYING my hardest to go to the gym and make healthier choices but it's a constant struggle and takes a lot of energy out of me, especially someone who HATES working out with a passion. I wish I was one of this fitness addicts, but sadly am not.Worst part is just having enough energy to get up in the morning.

It never goes away, I just have some days that I deal with it better than others. I'm not sure I've ever actually been happy in my life.I feel so disconnected from the rest of the world, especially from other people who have depression or talk about depression or treat depression, because the things they say about it make no sense to me and nothing seems to happen in the same way to me as other people. Medical professionals always ask me if I'm suicidal, and I know that's a thing, but only because people keep telling me so. Otherwise it makes as much sense to me as painting your nose blue for a broken arm. And then I guess since I'm not going to kill myself I'm not that bad off or whatever.I've been in therapy for about 15 years now, and to say it hasn't helped is an understatement. I can't think of a conversation I've had with a therapist where it felt like they understood what I was saying at all, or that we were even talking about the same thing. I've tried one therapist after another, taken all the medications they gave me. Literally no effect. That's not just my perception. My friends and family agree that none of the treatments seemed to be helping me, and so did my most recent therapist (who I saw for more than two years).I've tried the bad things, too. The things people do when they're hurting even though it's bad for them, but they don't stop because they just want to feel better. I made a serious, concerted effort to become an alcoholic, but it's really hard for me to get drunk. It costs $50-100 at a bar, and if I'm home alone I literally can't. I can drink until my head aches and I want to puke, but not get drunk. I tried drugs with similar results. (Admittedly nothing too hard - I'm afraid I'd get addicted and still not feel better.) I've tried physically hurting myself, but it only hurts. I've tried whoring around, and even that wasn't enjoyable (got kinda boring). I just need to feel better, but I can't figure out how. Literally nothing makes the pain stop. I've started thinking maybe I'm not human. Or maybe I'm stuck in some kind of artificial world, and it's like I'm trying to sate real hunger with virtual food. Of course it doesn't work. I don't know how to get out though. I don't know how to escape this feeling.",1

Anger and revolt with myself and the ones around me...I have a great girlfriend, a good job but I feel so bad about myself everyday, I actually started hating my self so much with no good reason.  Just want to be alone...Thought coming back home would help.Coming back home for the holidays my house is a wreck: my grandmother just started to have Alzheimer's (my birthday was actually the first day she didn't recognized me), my father is totally depressed, my mother is also lost and I keep on passing the days alpathic with no action whatsoever, and for some reason I feel angry, revolted and aparhic...just to feel guilt afterwards ...I do t know how to react and I keep on being a jerk or at least feeling like one. I hate myself and I keep on feeling angry by the fact that I cannot properly react or act upon the shedding place my home and my mind has become...I even thought about killing myself the past days but I think I really cannot...Being away now for two years also provided me with a feeling of not belonging anywhere (I also left home and my hometown at 18 until 32)...so I really feel I cannot belong, I feel bad, feel ugly, feel sad, feel alone.Am I becoming depressed and should I find some help? Or should I just try to do something about my atitude?I always think about getting help but I am always afraid of the medication..I know it sounds ridiculous...Thanks",1

1053,Do you ever just feel inexplicably weird? : Like my heart will feel heavy but I'm still so numb and I'll get all these thoughts of hurting myself being worthless and stupid but feeling really unaffected by them? I'll want to cry but all I can do is laugh at how much I hate myself. I don't even know how to explain but I'm both very aware of my own existence and start to get anxious about it while simultaneously being completely disconnected from myself.

I still go to meetings but even in a room full of people I can feel so alone. I don't have friends, no relationships the past few years, and now I guess I've isolated myself so much that I just don't know how to talk to people. I drive them away, and eventually, the contact will stop altogether. I don't know how I'll go through this year. I just hope I can make it to the three years in March. Thanks for reading. I don't expect people to really care, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.I hope everyone else has a better New Year than I did.",1

1060,"The trials : Hey. New to this community. But not really new to depression. I have been medicated a while and recently made the choice to try and handle life myself. Dont get me wrong. Im in a great place in life right now. I have an amazing boyfriend. My job is.... relatively great. I cant complain.The thing is, though... my demons still haunt me. I have a not-so-great family. That is my biggest hill to climb and always has been. I hate getting like this because I get so irritable and snap at my boyfriend. Any little thing triggers me and turns me into this hateful person. Don't get me wrong, I'm hurting. Im not a bad person but its easier to destroy relationships than build them, right? I think thats a common in this community. My other biggest vice is dependency. Right now the withdrawals from my medication are bringing me down, even though weed and nicotine help. Unfortunately, weed is hard to come by in my situation and the nicotine helps until I overdue it and feel terrible. Then when I run out of weed its like nothing is good and I hate everything. Maybe its just the dependency, and I know some of you may feel that drugs are terrible, but it helps. Because in this situation even a moment of relief is worth it, right? Sadly, I know sedation is only a temporary (and non-sustainable) solution. But it helps, right? I like smoking because it takes a whole cloud of thoughts, worries, and troubles to a minimum. It takes all the extra stuff away and at that point, its just me. I was the, hands down, happiest in my life when I was physically fit. I was serious about fitness and eating right at one time and thats something I want to get back from. But how do you make that step? I weigh the most I ever have, and also feel the worst. I know the solution, but actually doing it is so hard. Its so hard to focus on something when you are wearing a mask. Constantly focusing on keeping thoughts at bay is exhausting and all that I want to do is relax. Im sorry for the read. I know my first post is just a jumbled rant, but I wanted to give this community a try. Because even though I am terrible about giving the community I have IRL a chance, community is all we have, right? Best Wishes,Elijah.",1
1061,"I should be an actor, and for the wrong reason. : I've had anxiety problems since I was 9, when I changed to a new school. All the time, specially at school, I'm in this constant state of fear and stress. I feel like my life is a movie, and I have to act like I'm ok and try to mask my feelings, because otherwise I would probably lose the few friends that I still have, because I've been losing a lot of friends throw the years due to not socializing with many people and going out. I also feel like I don't belong to any group of people at my school, like I don't share enough interests with anyone to have a solid group of friends. Because of all these problems, I've been developing some problems with depression, that hit me when I'm alone with my thots, like when I'm trying to sleep or the whole holidays.

Over the years of struggling with my depression, and in the recent months, multiple suicide attempts and trips to the hospital, he has been hardly supportive, and during my younger years he was the source of my anger/depression. I finally told him about my feelings of resentment and anger towards him. I finally showed him the scars on my arm from self harm/suicide attempts. His only response to me was ""you have a lot of anger towards me"", and then he stormed out. But fuck him. I'm tired of penting up my emotions in fear of how he'll react to them.

1072,"My boyfriends depressed, I have BPD (borderline personality disorder). : My boyfriend of one year is extremely depressed. After noticing him starting to distance himself, not come see me as often as he usually would, I got upset with him. I have BPD and thought he was abandoning me. Thought he was trying to softly ghost me. Or just break up with me in general. He texted me randomly one day saying ""I'm sorry I'm like this right now"" and my dumb ass replied this long rant about how I don't understand why he's treating me like this all of a sudden and how its hurting me and blah blah. He comes back with these two paragraphs of how depressed he is and I instantly felt horrible. He's separated from his wife and the peak of the divorce is coming up. The house they lived in together is going up on the market soon finally (she still lives in it with their two kids), he's living in his parents basement, lost his job but started his own company which has got him extremely busy and exhausted lately, and he is just experiencing the holidays in this situation for the first time. He told me he's feeling a lot of guilt and self hatred. He's hurting for his kids going through all this. Told me he dreads waking up, he sits and stares at the wall a lot and cries every day. He's not eating and hides in his room when he's home. He just completely spilled his guts. I was there for him and have been since. But one thing started bothering me throughout this. He has never once said he loves me since this all started. I tell him all the time, I text him ""goodnight I love you"", ill randomly text him that I love him throughout the days. All of which he use to reply to but now he says nothing. I have passively mentioned this to him as I don't want to guilt him into saying it if its in-genuine. One day a couple weeks ago I decided to send him a (im sorry if this is TMI) nude, with the caption ""goodnight &lt;3"" to try and spark some bit of romance. And he replied with something along the lines of ""Oh my uhmmm goodnight"". And my confidence in the relationship hit the floor. Here I was making myself completely vulnerable trying to love him and he didn't give a fuck. I felt completely embarrassed. I don't know what to do anymore, he keeps telling me this is all him. Its not me. I didn't do anything. But I don't understand why he can't tell me he loves me. I know depression gets you in a state where you can't love yourself, can't love anything at all, but so much that you can't tell your significant other you love them? Is this normal?

Ive been depressed and anxious for most of my years, to make this step now is a huge milestone in acceptance and having enough. But I'm just pretty worried it's not going to be straightforward.

I am depressed, have social anxiety and ADHD and I don't know how to continue college when I'm in a bad place, and I don't know how to get out of the bad place if I continue college.

While battling lyme that gave me neurological problems and the worst anxiety and intense tiredness I have ever faced, I was asked to move out by my landlord. I wanted to give up, it took me months to find an affordable place to live and I was convinced I would have to move to my parents half way across the country. While I was in complete distress my boyfriend didnt want to be available to talk to me and needed to decompress. I was in complete turmoil and in the heat of my complete break down, I told him our relationship isn't working for me.

I am the most alone I have been, I spent new year by myself and spent most of my time moving my stuff without an ounce of help.

Now I have a job and I'm an adult who lives alone which allowed me to abuse stuff: alcohol, painkillers, antidepressants, cocaine, weed. I've done everything to feel just a bit numb or happy at least for a few minutes or hours.Recently I started getting better slowly, day by day. One day I hit the low again. I sat home and I was about to open a bottle of whisky and do some lines of coke then a random thought came through my mind:Depression ends or pauses eventually. For 7 years I was not that depressed. If I keep doing drugs and alcohol and abuse my body I might ruin it by the time my life gets better.What if your life suddenly takes a complete 180, you find the love of your life, you get kids, you get a great job and you don't get to experience those things for long because when you hit a low point a few years back your body took a toll that can't be repaired. I don't want to die on my future wife and kids in my 30s or 40s. If I get those things I want, I want to experience it for a lot of time and without health related complications.I hope some of you may start thinking differently due to this.

He is no longer married to me but no hassle of a divorce He can get a new girlfriend he actually wants to sleep with (if he doesnt already have one)People will always want to offer to babysit when a dead parent is involved so all the free time he wantsHe can get rid of all of my stuff and the kids stuff I hold on to for sentiment My kids dont deserve a mom who flies off the handle and yells and cries all the time anyways so they will be better off.Me being stupid and a coward is all that holds me back.

I start looking forward to the future and I just feel good. But then the night comes. All my anxiety comes back: Worries, nervousness, mistakes I made, âwhat ifsâ? And before I know it, i've fallen down a hole of depression. I find myself thinking of suicide and how it's not worth it. I feel guilty cause I know I have people who love me. But I feel so hurt. I feel horrible that i'll be paining them, but I would do ANYTHING to let go of all the pain I feel. This is my day to day life :(",1

I lived though a rape at 18I lived to see myself get married. I lived to see my two girls born. I lived to see my grandma die. I've lived to see my marriage fall apart with no way out. My will to live is gone. I've given up. If I didn't have my kids, I'd be gone. I've had friends leave because of my depression. I feel so alone. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't have a job.

Love, purpose, joy are things I don't seek out anymore simply because I don't believe they exist. I have become so nihilistic that I sometimes scare myself.

Even though I get good grades and all, I have been seriously considering dropping school and work for a semester and just leaving, and just going where I want to go for a change. I want a new experience. I want to get away from all this shit.Today, my mother says she's emotional - I ask her why, but I already know what its going to be about. About my grandparents and how much they miss me. A year ago I fell out with them, because I told my father about something that happened to me when I was young, four or five years old. My grandfather and I played a ""game"" once where we put our hands down each other's pants. We would also go skinny dipping in the pool a lot. I went through my early childhood thinking that this was normal behavior. I don't know if it's fucked me up psychologically or not but going into my teenage years it was always a passing thought and something that bothered me from time to time as I grew to understand that that shit was inappropriate.My father is a bipolar alcoholic and he lost it. Threatening to kill my grandfather, etc. Drunk calling them and telling them he was coming over. It was a mess. He reacted like a child and there was no way to put him on a leash. Anyways, every month or so for the past year my mother would bring it up to me even though I don't want anything to do with it. She is devastated that her parents and I no longer have a relationship. Quite honestly I couldn't care less if I don't have a relationship with her father seeing as he put his hands down my pants when I was four years old. But she just doesn't understand. She cries and cries and tells me they love me and that they miss me and that this is just such a pain for her and them to go through. She asks me if I really believe he meant to hurt me. I feel horrible and sometimes I regret ever saying anything.Maybe I'm the one in the wrong? I don't know. This is why I'm posting this, I need a second opinion. A lot of times I feel like a self-centered bastard because I can't just man up and pretend like nothing happened. But at the same time I will never be comfortable around my grandparents ever again. At the same time I don't think I will ever think or feel normal ever again. I have no one to talk to about this, I have no close friends anymore and I don't want something like this to affect people's opinion of me.",1

1112,"feeling trapped, indifferent, unable to solve anything, exhausted : everything just feels fucking empty. The only things that feel bearable to me are working, studying, and going to the gym, because those three things *might* be increasing the chance that one day I'll have a girlfriend who makes me as happy as my last did.Even though I keep putting in effort, I feel hopeless. I know there's a non-zero chance that I'll meet someone I like - frankly that's the only thing that has kept me going since we broke up a year ago - but it seems so unlikely. I'm fucking trash, socially. I can't hold a conversation to save my life. I don't have the mental wherewithal to force myself into social situations to get any better. I'm just boring as shit to talk to.And I look like shit. Despite successfully dieting and exercising for the past 5 years, I just can't escape my shitty pear-shaped body. I was morbidly obese for my entire childhood, up until age 18, and my proportions are just permanently fucked up from that. Even at 5'10 and 139 lbs, I still had visible lovehandles, a sagging stomach, and oversized thighs. And I'm going bald in the worst fucking way possible. I'm 24 and my hairline hasn't receded, but my hair has thinned to the point of being completely see-through on the entire top of my head. I worked and lived at home for 6 months to save up $30,000 to go to the best hair transplant surgeon I could find, at which point I found out that I'm losing too much hair to be a viable candidate. I tried shaving my head, and that just made it worse - I couldn't stand to look at myself.and I feel like I deserve this, for being such a superficial piece of shit. I have a good job, I make a lot of money, and I take care of myself - Realistically, I know I could end up with a girlfriend. Plenty of boring, ugly guys are in happy relationships. But I can't settle. I tried. At 22, having never even kissed a girl, I said fuck it and dated a girl I wasn't especially physically attracted to, thinking that maybe it would happen if I opened myself up to the possibility. After three months, nothing had changed, and I had to break up with her. Shortly after, I met a girl I was **actually** crazy about, asked her out expecting nothing, and we wound up being in a relationship for about a year.being with her was the only time since childhood that I felt truly happy and comfortable with myself. I didn't care that I never had anything to say to anyone, or that I didn't have the body I wanted - I had a girlfriend, and that was all I needed. And I could say ""well if she was attracted to me, then surely another girl like her - who I would like as much as her - could also be attracted to me too,"" but it isn't that simple. She didn't know I was losing my hair. I wore a special dust you can put into thinning hair to make it look thicker; Basically, make-up. For the entire year we were together, I made sure that I always had it in when I was in her presence.And even putting the hair make-up stuff aside, I simply don't think I'll have a chance to meet anyone, even if they're out there. Because of the first paragraph of this post. Everything feels empty. Everything feels like shit. I don't do anything besides work, study, and exercise, and I don't **want** to do anything else. I hate this fucking cycle. I can't wait to give up. I can't wait to die.",1

I can't see myself still being active for more than another two years. I just feel like there isn't enough fuel in the tank.

It was fucking horrible. There was so many reasons I should've killed myself through the years, but I never brought myself to finish it. I think this years going to be the breaking point. I'm so fucking scared. I don't want to die but suicide has been slowly becoming more and more rational to me. A social recluse, trans, bulimic, I'm basically bound to kill myself. I'll just be another statistic. I just want everything to stop for once and truly feel nothing. Not numbness, not anxiety, not crushing sadness, not hate, not dysphoria but nothing.

I was in my car with a buddy, talking about how I could make some money, spitballing ideas(one of them was selling juul pods lol) when a family of fancily dressed assholes approached my car. They were angry with me because they thought I clipped their car at some point and wanted to be paid for their damages. I knew it was bullshit and I dont know what came over me but I was just filled with a combination of rage and a mindset of 'Wow, I don't give a single shit about anything right now.'I got back in my car, told my friend to get out, and slammed into their passenger side door right before taking off onto the road. Before long I was on the interstate traveling at about 100 mph before smacking directly into a semi.. and then black.It looked like a weird combination of fortnite and gta but all of a sudden I was parachuting back down to earth and in my vision were the numbers 3, 2, 1.. and I woke up, back in the backseat of my car where I've been sleeping, sweaty as all hell.I thought I died, and the next 5-10 minutes were very dissociating - all I know is I have a new appreciation for life and suicide is off that table. I'm grateful for my car -my home-, im grateful for my clothes, im grateful for my friends and family, im grateful for nature and the twisted beauty of humanity, and I dont want to lose any of it.TL;DR: I had a bizarre dream where I died and basically respawned, woke up with a new appreciation for my situation",1

This year I have been doing amazing, I've made great friends, graduated school and started my career. I also started transitioning from male to female which also improved my mental health. I started HRT also which mostly cured my anxiety and depression. And when I did have panic attacks I was more easily able to control my emotions and snap out of it. But this week I've been having issues with social isolation because of the social groups I normally go to not meeting due to NYE week. And I also was too lazy to make plans for NYE so as a result I had no one to hang out with. I tried doing exercise to improve my mental health, and it didn't really work today or yesterday. I also have been getting less work (presumably due to the holidays). I'm a freelancer, so I can work whenever I want too. The issue of not getting enough work is also stressing me out due to the fact I have lots of debt. This hasn't been a problem for me until the holiday season. Perhaps it's just normal for their to be less IT work during the holiday season and in a few weeks it will pick up again.

I've struggled making friends pretty much my entire life (except for when I was young and basically everyone was friends with everyone else). I've been on suicide watch for over a week twice in the last 10 years and attempted suicide nearly successfully in September. Things in my personal life have been absolute hell for the last year and a half and since starting my new career (which is freelance and work-from-home) I'm more lonely and isolated than ever. I have friends, but they all have friends they're closer to and/or friend groups that I'm not apart of, which really makes me feel like I have no friends at all. Seeing everyone celebrate the joy in the last 10 years of their lives is making me feel like an absolute failure at life itself. My social skills have developed tremendously in the last 3 years but essentially having no friends right now is really killing me inside. I want to be able to reflect on everything that's happened in the past 10 years (especially the last two) for the purposes of personal growth but all I feel is pain inside for everything that's happened, the opportunities I've missed, and the feeling that I'm wasting my life away being constantly depressed. I don't know what's going to become of me if things don't get better really, really soon.",1
1138,"The end seems closer than usual. : Years of clinical depression thought me some survival skills that I can use during the normal days, yet extreme is still of out my reach in terms of panic or sadness. Can I just delete myself as I tried three times already? There's sadness, there's a family I care of and honestly, that's one of the main thoughts that keeps me alive. The sadness I always lived with came back doubled in strength, with the notes that describe my end, with the ironic smile I can provide.&amp;#x200B;And here I am, writing those notes, my thoughts that are coming out faster I can analyze, there's the world I lost but wanted to, there are people I care about that just can't anymore. If people still care then those people are carrying my pain and they're the only the family I have. Only people I still can write a message to. Please give me the rest, out of the pain I was feeling those years, countless pills that only hide the pain, the suicide I can relate to, I'm feeling my wines, my brain, my head, my emotions.&amp;#x200B;I wish I could get rid of the emotions and just live the life as it is, but learned already I cannot. The pain was always coming back and ot's now with me, as it was before. It's kinda soft and comfortable, knowing the time is coming, the person you care you if seeing other stars. &amp;#x200B;My time is coming, regardless how irrelevant the time is.&amp;#x200B;My monster came again, I wasn't ready.",1

1141,"2020 is gonna start out rough. : As of posting this there are 4 hours and -- minutes  left 2019. It's been so lonely thinking about how everyone has love on the holidays and a great family while I'm stuck with neither. I wanted to up and kill myself on Christmas, but as I went to I saw that the 2 bullets I had were missing. I wasn't planning on using the bullets anytime soon cuz I don't have a gun, but I was very quickly dissuaded and I didn't feel like doing it anymore. Now it's close to 2020 where New Years is gonna be lonely and Valentine's day is gonna be the damn worst, not only is it the day to appreciate love and I'm probably one of the most lonely bastards to be alive right now, but it's my birthday. I'm gonna start off 2020 with the worst luck and I'm sure there are other people out there that have worse and I'm sorry, I just needed to rant cuz I just feel I have no one to talk to. I'm glad I got that out, but now it's a matter of surviving the rough luck through the beginning of 2020.",1
1142,Is it normal to feel like I'll eventually take my life one day? : I'm not sure why I feel this way. I'm 18 and I'm in college pursuing a career in graphic design with a girlfriend I've been with for almost a year (January 27). I feel like everything is fine right now but I know as soon as my girlfriend leaves for college or the Navy I know I'm probably going to take my life. I don't have any friends and my girlfriend came to me right before high school let out. I was planning on going to college but knew I'd end up killing myself eventually due to a lack of motivation then my girlfriend came along. My girlfriend gave me something to look forward too and not only did she give me a loving relationship but she gave me my bestfriend. I know how selfish and clingy I am for feeling this way and I'm ashamed to admit to it but it's true. If my future is going to be spent alone with my thoughts then I'm not sure if I want a future. I'm overall not really happy with life I put a smile on my face and try to make everyone else around me as happy as I can but unfortunately it doesn't make me happy and fulfilled like I hoped. I really just want to be with the person I love because that's the only thing I look forward and again knowing I won't be able to do that doesn't give me much drive to really carry on.I wish I could tell her and apologize for being the way I am but I know if I did she'd probably leave me or be too scared to pursue her dreams and while my thoughts are selfish I'm not selfish enough to get in the way of someone's aspirations.,1

I hate my life so much her family were so nice to me. I just want to die and breakdown I haven't cried in 7 years and all I want to is fully open up and cry  in her arms she was the best thing that has ever happened to me my most amazing relationship the only person that cards and tried to make me happy the only person that made me smile.

1146,"The holidays are the most difficult. : Not a big reddit poster, but I felt like this has been past due for myself. The holidays honestly are so hard for me to get through. I've spent the last 6 years of major holidays alone. Mostly because of my retail job, I never get enough time off around the holidays to go home and spend it with family, nor have they been able to visit me. My condolences to anyone else spending this time of year alone no matter what the circumstances may be. I moved to a new state 9 months ago and it's been a tough struggle meeting new friends as I didn't know anyone here before I moved.  Now it's new years and all of my ""friends"" I've made while here yet again flaked on me (was actually excited to have plans for the first time I remember in a while), which I recently found out has been a common occurrence of them just getting together without me. (Which I'm used to at this point, it is what it is). It just sucks knowing you're always the last choice in anyone's lives. And that my depression may be the cause of my 'boringness'/lack of interest my friends have towards me. Any tips on making friends for someone struggling mentally? I'm just tired of this constant weight of loneliness bearing down on me. I seriously can't remember the last time someone went out of their way to invite me to something. It seems like I'm always asking to tag along, and then I'm just a burden at that point, which is why I'm starting to lose all hope. Whoever takes the time to read this, thank you.",1
1147,"Thanks : I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who has commented on my posts this last year. I'm still in a very dark place but having a forum where it feels like people actually listen and possibly even care a little feels nice. First nice this in a long time.

1150,"Will getting a new pet help to ease depression? : I have a dog since 2008 but it stays outside only because my parents don't want it into the house.It lives in the garden, in the lawn or at my uncle's place where he is rather spoiled (he eats whatever he likes because both us and him give him food, we walk him sometimes, he can go on the couch or into my uncle's old bedroom on the bed too).He needs a bath etc but aside from him I considered getting a new small pet, I know they are not toys or anything and need to be taken care of.I considered a rat, an hamster or a rabbit. Birds are cute but I don't like getting them into a cage and stuff and it would complicated to train them and leave them into the house.Fish are pretty but you cannot interact with them so...I am thinking about a couple of small domestic rats, I read they are friendly and clean compared to hamsters.What do you think?",1

Not with that big mole on your back. Some people just aren't meant to wear dresses.

But I guess it takes some people time to learn how the world works. I have changed into a t shirt and jeans.I'm not sure why I posted this, maybe for pity, maybe for you to tell me I'm disgusting. Honestly either works. He suggested I sell all my dresses on eBay to pay for a mole removal but they apparently cost like $800 and they can grow back. So I don't really even want to bother.",1

There's not a single memory I have where I wasn't in some amount of physical pain.And then doctors try to say it's a symptom of depression. Wouldn't it make more sense that I'm depressed because I'm constantly on physical pain - not the other way around?The only reason I keep going is to enjoy nature. It used to be nature and my friends. But my friends, well...one is being a giant asshole, ones not speaking to me...the others I keep at an arm's length...I just needed my best friend to tell me he was sorry I don't feel well today. It's the worst pain I've ever been in in my life. I feel so horrible, I thought maybe it's meningitis. I have a fever and a headache and my whole body feels like it's burning from my bones to my skin. It's like I'm full of crushed glass. Like gout, but everywhere. I woke up and I cried and I begged for god to kill me. And his response was, âIf I get sick again, I'm gonna be so fucking pissed.â?All I needed was care.No one really cares.Why do I continue to live in agony to spare these people's feelings? And nature is dying. Why do I continue to live to watch the thing I love most die?Because I'm a coward. And I want to die painlessly and quickly. And I don't know how.Please.

1166,"[Resident Physician] Horribly depressed, months after failing to match for residency : I knew I wanted to be an ER doctor early on in med school. Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. M app, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on boards with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I matched on March 16, 2020, and that statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.So if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of imemdiately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing.I've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I'm convinced that if I find out I didn't match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. There won't be anything worth living for anymore. Having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any other field would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. My medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in March 2019. We will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged in March 2020 and I get to continue on my journey to become an ER doctor.&amp;#x200B;If not...goodbye cruel world.",1

1169,"New Years : Okay so for a couple years now I've been feeling depressed, and a year ago maybe, I told my mum I wanted some help (e.g. therapy, doctor), yet she said no because it would show up ""on my record"" and would look bad (I guess for jobs but idk why they would need to know that). Anyway, this year it was particularly bad especially round xmas, cause of a number if things: our family like fully fell apart so we have no more contact with my grandparents, cousins etc., I don't really want to say anything specific due to privacy things but a close family member ended up in hospital from the 24th (xmas eve) to the 27th, and on top of that my mum brought her boyfriend over for xmas, who I don't like and they've only known each other for like 2 months anyway. So after all of this I go out with some friends for new years and this is where it gets bad. I usually drink and I'm fine with it but for new years I think just cause I was really down I just drank a shit ton and blacked out, so my friends had to take care of me. That's one thing is that they had to take care of me which I feel bad about cause I genuinely ruined their night, but on top of that after one person sent me the videos I just saw myself saying stuff that was super out of hand in that I was just unloading all of my emotions and talking about how I hated life etc. So now I feel like shit cause I feel like I was such an asshole by drinking that much and making it so unpleasant for everyone else. But now I'm thinking more about what happened and after talking to my mates some more I think the best way forward is to get some help, yet I know that when I ask my mum she will say no. The other thing is I may be able to get help without parents involved, I don't know how that all works. Anyway that's what I wanted to get out, I just want some help, thanks",1
1170,I had a panic attack trying to do my favorite hobby.. : I don't know why it happened and I'm still freaked out and scared..I'm an artist I like to draw cartoon animals and animate too. I've always been into cartoons and animation when I was a kid and I'm 17 and still watch cartoons. But I've been so depressed lately it feels like my mind is numb I haven't drawn in weeks lately..and I know I should do it again so I don't you know forget how to draw lol. Tonight I got a comment on my (old) YouTube speedpaint video it's been a while since anyone has commented I haven't uploaded in a few years because of my condition. It read âare you alive?â?And i was worried and also happy that someone still cared and I thought maybe I'll get my tablet out and draw again. But once I got it out and started drawing the sketch I felt my chest getting tight and it was so hard to breath..and the more I continued to draw it got even tired and I felt a panic! I stopped and threw my tablet on my bed away from me and stopped. I was breathing heavily and my head felt weird at the same time. I had a damn panic attack! I was so scared my worst fear has happened and I can't draw! If I keep getting a panic attack every time I draw I don't think I'll be able to enjoy anything..!! I still can't calm down and it's very hard to whenever I see a drawing or try to draw myself I feel a panic attack coming on..I feel like I got like this because I couldn't feel anything. Usually when I draw It feels nice and enjoyable bring my dream characters to life on paper or digital especially when animating. But it's been so long since I felt happy that I can't even be happy trying to draw I don't know if that makes any sense but I'm freaking out! I've been depressed for way to long and I need help but my parents don't believe I have depression even when I told them I had suicidal thoughts. It got worse to the point that feel like I should kill myself..no matter how many times I tell my parents I don't think they understand how bad this really is...this is really bad..I need help and soon because I don't know what to do..,1

1172,"I'm sorry, the stress and anxiety is too much : Yesterday I was talking to my girlfriend; we were having a great time and then something came up about her ex. In the past I have insecurities about certain things in relationships and because my insecurities were proven to be true right after the relationships ended I still have those insecurities. I keep trying to handle them and fix them in a healthy way.A while ago her ex texted her saying he was sorry for all he did to her and what not and I was okay with it because I've begun to cope with my insecurities but I'm also scared of my girlfriend getting hurt so I was a little cautious.It wasn't until yesterday when she said her ex wanted to call her on New Years; I didn't like it but I kept trying to tell myself it's okay because it is and I don't want to be controlling but she kept asking for my input and I guess my brain couldn't handle anything and I essentially malfunctioned, I couldn't think and I couldn't answer her question cause all I could focus on was not being controlling and she kept saying it was okay and basically I had an anxiety attack.The constant looming anxiety lasted until 9am in the morning as I couldn't sleep the entire night, after sleeping two hours I woke up because of it and didn't sleep until around 4 where I only slept another two hours. Idk if it's the depression or the anxiety but I only really ate cereal at like 3 am and it's been an entire day; there are sharp pains in my stomach and now it's gone away and has went to my stress. I don't know if it's my asthma or the stress or anxiety and honestly I'm scared. I'm shaking. I'm sad that I'm worrying my girlfriend. And I'm still overtaken by anxiety and I don't know what to do. I've been trying to distract myself with the new plants I got but it's not helping; I feel like I'm in a emotionally and physically painful hole.Also I don't blame my girlfriend she's nice and I just think I picked the wrong way to deal with my insecurities and now it's biting me in the butt. She's perfect really and I wish I could say the same for myself.I just need help please or someone to talk to for encouragement. Thank you for any help",1
1173,"Going to College Really Messed Up My Self Esteem and Self Worth I Feel Like a Shell of My Former Self : Really just been having a bad past few days and thought screw  it why not post on here and a few other subsI come from a very wealthy family from New York my father is a well known businessman throughout the area. I had a very good upbringing with very little issues was a social kid growing up and had plenty of friends. Most of my friends growing up would tell me how they wish they had my life or where my sibling. Back in 2012 I was a senior in High School. I know it's a joke to say that some people peaked in high school and I really think I actually have. Back then I was a relativity liked kid I was captain of the wrestling and lacrosse teams the typical jock. I was mostly well liked by everyone and had no major issues. Other than a few fights I didn't start. I never really had a serious relationship then but, I had no trouble getting with girls or speaking to them. I never really thought of myself as good looking. But girls tell their friends they thought I was hot and would have no problem speaking to them and hooking with them or getting laid. As for grades I did pretty good in High school and got in a very good University in upstate New York (We can call X) that I was looking forward to attending my **entire life** until then. Both of my grandparents meet at X and my both of my aunt and uncle went there too. I knew X was a very good school academic wise and carried a lot of weight.But what made me want to go X the most was party scene there one of the best of the country. It was known for its Greek Life as being the somone of wildest parties. However, around that time my parents marriage began falling apart As I began to learn about my father's infidelity with nemours women behind my moms back. I began partying way more on the weekends especially when I finished my high school sports. I soon became a huge pothead smoking weed as a way to cope with what was happening in my life and a way to rebel against my dad. However like anything too much is bad. I can admit I smoked way too much and it began to affect me socially and became known as stoner.When I got to X for my freshman for my first semester freshman year it was undoubtedly the best time of my entire life and boy did I pay for it in the long run. As soon as I got there I made lots of friends in my dorms and found an easy connect for weed who grew. Every Night I was going to a different frat party(frats invite freshman guys in begging to get them to join), hooking up with tons of hot girls and making new making friends. There was a group of guys all in my dorm I became friends with. One the guys got me really into working out and I got in pretty decent shape. However, that semester I might've had a great partying and hooking up with tons of girls. However towards the end of the semester I also got caught with weed in my dorm and was accused of being a massive dealer and was on the verge of getting thrown out of school. My parents were so pissed at me and threatened to pull me from X then(I wish they did).I basically went to the schools version of a  North Korean court trial with a bunch of the dean's staff and some professors. They used a bunch of false accusations from âwitness in the dormsâ?that I had a major weed dealing operation which was total bullshit. At most I sold a few dub bags to my friends who were dry. They found no evidence of money, scales or baggies. They found a grinder in my desk with like a gram in it. But This one dean there really had it out for me. Because my family over the years gave the school boat loads of money. It would but the school in a sticky situation if they threw me out.  That if they did they would lose scholarships and donations that my family supported. So the people in the North Korean style banana court did they best they could to make my life miserable there I would have no choice but to quit and transfer out. They were going to move me to a dorm which is for foreign transfer students for the rest of my freshman year. I had a room all for myself in the basement floor which they could easily watch me and surveill. I was 3 miles off campus that I had to take a bus to class everyday. I had to be in the dorm in my room by 10pm during the week and 11pm on weekends unless I had permission slips from my community service, which i had to do 165 hours of. Lastly I was forbidden from doing a fraternity from my entire time at X. If failed to listen to any of these absurd rules I was thrown out of X. I begged my parents to let me leave X but they were so upset I got in trouble there. They said I needed to stay or it would cause problems with my family. When I came back for the next semester I learned Mostly all of my guy friends did the rush and I Had a falling out with them. I wasn't able to hangout with them because they made me move dorms. And I had to be back by curfew. Plus I had to work for The house of Daniels(Christian Charity) for my community service. Which I hated I was jewish and they kept trying to convert me. I soon had less and less people to hangout with other then my local weed dealer who didn't go to school at X. I realized that if you are not part of Greek life, sports teams are in with the super Rich Asians if you go to school at X Your social life is basically dead or non-existent. Soon all the girls I hooked up with the previous semester all rushed sororities. When I would see a girl who I had sex with the previous semester and spoke with frequently. They would ignore me when I would walk by them on campus and not even look at me. I never felt so awkward and embarrassed before in my entire life. What also made it worse is that when I got into S. I barely got in because its hard school academically. I was not even in the major I wanted to be in(Real Estate). I soon began there was nothing left for me at X and I didnt wanna be there anymore âI was not having a good timeâ? The social butterfly inside me was pissed I was gonna be there while every was doing the rush and making new friends. I was never the lone wolf type always on a sports team and had friendships. X is also in a very snowy aerea and I soon began to felt like a prison of snow. What also made it worse that X is in some run-down rust belt city with a high crime rate. I felt so trapped and wanted to transfer out. I was able to finish my freshman second semester thanks to going to the gym everyday and working out like a madman. That summer after my freshman year I once again begged my parents and they said no, you have to go back. I didn't pick a dorm for my sophomore year because I wanted to transfer.  I was finally free and could live where I want didn't have a curfew. I got picked a  random roommate because I didn't know anyone. I got picked with TK an Asian kid whos straight off the boat from Japan and spoke broken English. I dorm live far from campus but I could smoke in my dorm because there were no RA. By sophomore year my only hope was to get into the real estate school at X so I could learn it before I worked for my family business. MY life was at the beginning of my sophomore year was revolved around going to class and getting good grades( which I did I made deans list for the rest of my time at S). Going to the gym which I did compulsively It was the way I Physically let out all my anger of being at X and noting being able to do the greek life there and being stuck there and I got pretty jacked got my deadlift to 605, Squat 455 and 365 Bench. TK began to warm up to me and start smoking weed eventually and I had someone to sort-of hangout with. I didn't go to the school gym because all the greek life kids ran it and I felt embarrassed going alone. I went to a local gym in X which mostly people form the inner city went to. I was the only white kid there and stuck out like a sore tump. But everyone was kind to me and there was some very strong people there who motivated me to get better. I made friends with someone of the people at the gym and they invited me to their parties(only went to a few). I would brink TK and we would hang out with the inner city people form the gym in the projects but we only did on occasion. I found it funny how my parents were sending me an elite private university and I would go to the hood to hangout instead my own school. I soon learned that I couldn't switch into the real estate major because of my prior offenses my freshman year getting caught with weed. My uncle who is on the Alumni board of the real estate school couldn't even push me in. I was so upset because I wanted to go to X my entire life and it was all in shambles. My life revolved around going to class, smoking weed and the gym. I basically had no social life outside of it and was not involved with anything else at X because nothing else interested me there. It was a jail I then became angry and then very depressed for the rest of my time there using the gym and weed as my outlet for my anger and sadness. I saw pictures on social medial of guys who I was friends with freshman year killing it in the frats partying with the hottest girls. While I was at home on a friday night smoking a bong playing xbox with TK. Being the person who I was in high school I could never see this happening to myself I was always with the ""in"" crowd and never had any if much with trouble with girls. Now I was the outcast and it hurt so much. I had to lie to all my friends from home and family I liked it at X going to school there. But in reality I hated the place more than any other on earth. It got especially hard before my senior year, TK was abroad that semester and were not moving into a house until the second semester. I was forced to live in a dorm and it was so hard seeing all the freshman move in all happy on my floor while I was there as a senior was gut wrenching to watch. I was so upset at my parents for sending me back up there. I was like a hermit who liked in my room and only left for class, gym and getting weed. I staying in my dorm room the entire time playing xbox live with kids I met from online.I went back home for the summer after a horrible semester to beg my parents to let me leave X. They simply wouldn't let me do it it was so upset. My father told me he did not want to upset my grandma and the rest of my family and it would cause problems. But that summer at home was fun I was social and went to lots of parties and hooked up with a few girls I felt like my old self again. I didn't sign up for housing that year because I thought I Was gonna transfer home to my local community college till i figured out what I wanted to do.I really hated going to school at X I completely understand it was my fault and put myself completely in that situation. However, I was very pissed at my parents for making me stay there after I got my grades up. I understand it would have pissed off the rest of my family. But I was so depressed and hated every single day there I felt like I wasn't event a real student at X. I just went there for classes and lived in a shitty rust belt city where I smoked and played xbox all day. Gone was the once charismatic person who loved to be socialize and party and became something I was not. But what was the most hurtful part was on the inside I was the same person. It was killing me knowing there where tons of good memories I could've been having like how college was supposed to be . I was like going to an amusement park watching tons of people having fun and not being allowed to go on any of the rides. You just saw everyone else having a good time while I was left standing there with my dick in my hand. The only time I ever really back then would party and hook up with girls was when I went back home on breaks and during the summer again made X feel like a prison to me. The only thing keeping me going at school was the gym, weed and knowing the faster I get a degree the faster I get out of X.Eventually I graduated with honors and got into a really good MBA program in NYC with a concentration in real estate finance. Doing the MBA program I feel so much better and it feels good to have a social life again but I admit sometimes I hold on to old habits with staying in . But I feel like I missed out on the prime years of my life and have lots of regret and way more anger. I find that because of the way I lived in X many of my social and interpersonal skills with other people has rapidly declined. I hate to use this word but my""game"" with girls is non existent. I finally now I am starting to get laid again more regularly but it's only because drunk girls think im hot(in their words) because I spent the past 5 years working out like a madman. But I can't keep any girls for long because I have the social skills and game of a four year old. I still have so much anger towards my parents for making me stay at X too. At the time they said I had to learn from my lesson. But they knew I was Miserable. I still feel a lot of trauma from going to school at X.",1
1174,"Why do I care what people think? : I don't want to care what people think, I don't want to feel the hurt anymore. I moved to the US from Spain when I was eight. My mother married and abusive piece of shit, and quite honestly I can't remember the last time I was happy. I am nineteen now, I dropped out of highschool due to the never ending loop of anxiety and depression. I've quit two jobs so far and training for a new job starts next week.Today, I had a particularly bad day, I opened up to a friend about my problems with trusting and bonding with new people. I also contacted the girl who took my virginity, which I haven't done in almost a year. I called her and she was at work waiting for her ride home. I guess she was with a co-worker or something because she started talking about how I dropped out of high school. Then she asked me if I'm going to college, and I told her I don't know. She was telling me to stop being 'pricky', I literally said nothing to offend her and she just has to go and restate the fact that I didn't graduate. Gee thanks for reminding me that I'm a fucking loser, I didn't know.My mother doesn't make it any easier with her constant 'screaming her head off, because I'm unhappy with my life' attitude.I'm tired, I don't want to deal with it anymore",1
1175,"Just a couple of feelings. And, ""hello, friends!"" : It's January 1st, 2020. I have never published anything in Reddit before, but I found some posts here that encouraged me to write a little on my feelings.I have just graduated from high school in November (I am not American nor living in Europe). Now I am about going to start my university studies. I am quite young, most of my colleagues were older than me, and I am younger than the average first-year student in almost countries. I always felt somewhat misplaced and disinterested in what young people do.I didn't attend my class's prom party. At first, I was thinking financially, as it is not rational to expend a truckload of money in a stupid and small event. My mother got really upset with my decision, but I didn't dare to explicitly say that I was worried about getting us into debt. After some months, my motivations to not attending it was not having established friendships with most of my classmates; I had a few moments of unpleasantness with some of them, but I have no contempt for almost anyone. It was an elite school, with only eight people in the class, most of them extremely affluent.As well, utter all compliments I hear is about how smart I am, and I have a gracious complexion. I fell as having no true friends - since I was little I got to be surrounded by adults. Today, I was invited by a friend to some museums with her, but I do not feel as sharing secrets as I never could open myself on the pains â?physical and psychic ones â?to someone. Every day, I fear ending up alone, as I am too avoidant or critical, applying the latter both to myself and to the significant one, and I do not have hope on a great career or in a profitable marriage (I live in the western world, but marriage for convenience is appealing.)My father quit his job and now tries to succeed in life as a businessman, but the economic scenario in our country has never been good. This past year, my mother, who worked from home for a few years, went into a stable job, but it does not pay too well. Through the year, I tried to make some money â?I intended to start investing and also to create an emergency fund, but I always dreamt about moving abroad â?considering I am going to study Mathematics and Astronomy; I live in a hostile place to be a scientist, and there were a lot of relatives of mine setting up our documents to live in Europe. I started to spend a lot of money using credit cards, but it was necessary, and then I have to start my savings all over again, after paying what I owe the bank.My dream university changed its calendar to entrance examinations in a way that I could not be admitted. I am going to matriculate myself in one of the most prestigious university in my country, as it has no tuitions and a demanding pace of studies, and studying abroad is no longer affordable. I have thought a lot on not studying Astronomy â?or something as Fine Arts or Philosophy, my other passions â?in favour of something that has chances of getting rich, as Medicine.I cannot take anymore what made me feel so out of place these past few years â?I don't have a boyfriend, I don't go to those promiscuous, opulent parties, and I don't travel around the world during the summer holidays. I can no longer delay my visits to doctors for not having the courage to tell someone what I feel, that my allergies weaken me more than ever, that my eyes burn like hell and every inch of my body hurts, and the fear of going to a psychiatrist. I tried therapy a few years ago, and the therapist was able to make me feel worse, as the school educational coordinator.I am always afraid of not being sufficiently grateful for what I have on Earth, that I have a great background. Poetry can make my breath somewhat lighter, but, consonant to my vision issues and to the stress I was subjected to, I was reading fewer books. I started to believe that I can only hold my life with missions to accomplish, and creating art, fortunately, was a solace in the plethora of trouble I got into, maybe for my future good.",1

How did you change your thinking?  How did you explain to yourself certain things?

1186,"I'm a burden to my wife. : I keep feeling like I'm a burden on my wife. When she does something unintentionally which hurts me, if I express my feelings to her, it turns into an argument and she get hurt and out the window go my feelings and the need the address them.That leads me to try and avoid that by not saying anything, which to no surprise ends up causing bottled up feeling that then just come out at the worst time in the worse way. I've tried very hard to explain to my wife how I feel and what would help me in certain situations. How certain things trigger me, and how they can be diffused and so on. More important, I try very hard to make myself aware of my behavior, how I read things, how I react, what I say and how I say it, and I try my best to improve. I only ask my wife for help in helping me improve. But there are times where she does something or says something that is hurtful, and she's oblivious to it. And I can't help but feel very hurt. When I bring it up, no matter if I preface it with it being just me and my interpretation of the situation, it being whatever baggage I have, saying that she didn't do anything wrong but I'm feeling as I am and need her help and affection, it doesn't matter. It simply leads to her shutting down, and then my feelings are compounded because I was already feeling like shit, and now I'm feeling worse because my issue didn't get resolution, I got no affection, and now I feel guilt for making her feel bad. And in that moment all I want to do is go away and never come back. We had an argument today because of a misunderstanding, and I was already feeling down, but she kept making comments, as she usually does, of how she just wants peace. And every time she says that, it makes me feel as though she thinks I want war instead of peace. Which couldn't be further from the truth. For some reason today it just put me over the edge. In that moment I was really hoping that I would be struck by lightning, or killed in some way, because all I feel is guilt, for making her feel the way she does. I feel like a complete burden to her. Every time it's me and my actions or my inability to let something go that's causing her peace to be destroyed. And I just can't tolerate being a burden to her anymore. I have usually kept my desire to die or go away for good to myself. But today, I told her. I told her I wish I could just die and go away so that I would never be a burden to her again. And I meant it sincerely because she is a wonderful person, and I hate how I make her feel.She responded by saying she's never been so hurt by anything else that I've ever said. So I left the house, and for the first time I can ever recall, I actually stopped to look around and think this is the last time I'm going to see this house. She was in bed covered up, so I went and just said a simple goodbye and left. Later on we texted and it only added fuel to fire. I told her via text that I feel like a burden to her. And that without me she would be free, she would be happy, and she would have a peaceful life. And her response was that she was disappointed in me and hurt. I feel like dying because since I was a kid I've been a burden. And here I'm trying to tell my wife how I feel, that I wish I'd die, and It seems I just can't escape causing her pain.  If I kill myself, it's going to cause her and my mom a lot of pain. For that reason alone I haven't done it. But being myself and being in my wife's life seems like I cause her just as much pain. I have no idea what else to do at this point. Either way I'm a burden and that feeling is just eating away at me more and more everyday.",1

I'm happier having him but not attaching too much of myself for now). Then I read some posts that would make me feel better...in this community perhaps. It feels good that people are helping and not being judgmental to each other. It took me some time to move and get going to start my day.I forced myself to get up, fold my clothes, fix my bed.

After telling them to stop a few times over the course of a few weeks and them not stopping, I got fed up and confronted them in a way that burned bridges. We haven't spoken since then and the only other people I talked to in my town were mutual acquaintances that stopped talking to me too. I recently tried to reach out to my old best friend to ask why he did I have some really great friends back at college, they're awesome and don't treat me like dirt. The only problem with them is that they live nowhere near me so whenever I'm home, I'm mostly just chilling in my room doing nothing or hanging out with my parents. I'm honestly sick of feeling lonely, but I'm not sure where to start because my town is really small and there's not a lot to do around here. Because of my friends being cruel, I've lost a lot of confidence so it's hard to want to trust people or to meet new people (which I understand is the antithesis of my problem.)If anyone is going through a similar experience or has advice, I'd appreciate it if you shared/have anything.

1192,"Is depression and night sweats a normal withdraw symptom of weed? : Hey guys, To give u some perspective I am a 19 year old male. I quit my job doing full time phone sales and began smoking weed everyday so I have only smoked heavily for about 2 or 3 months. about 3 months ago and that's when this kind of all started. I have begun to reevaluate my life choices. Seeing how much money And time I'm wasting I started really slowing down on weed going from smoking everyday to only smoking on weekdays and on Dec 30th I haven't smoked anything and plan to go 30 days without it. Since I began slowing down on weed and now fully stopping it I have been feeling depressed randomly. I would say at least half the time I feel very low. I have no Debt about 6k in savings plenty of people who care about me, have a GED  am decent or at least average looking and am in decent physical shape or in other words I have no legitimate reason to be depressed. I do think about suicide more often but am not making plans to do it. But I do feel very depressed no one knows about this. Some of my symptoms since quitting are being unable to sleep or stay asleep, depression and night sweats and I haven't had these before I started smoking weed. I just want to know if this is normal when quitting weed, or if u guys believe this is an underlying problem and how I should cope or speed up this progress to get rid of it.

1193,"You've got to follow your gut. : I've been told for such a long time that âI need to do what's right for meâ?and âfollow your gutâ?but I've never been able to determine what that was. This morning I was supposed to go on a dream trip, Singapore to Vietnam to Japan then back home. I should probably preface that with I also recently returned back from seeing my recently divorced parents for Christmas (found out my dad now has a kid with a woman my age) and I've been a wreck. For a lot of reasons that I won't go into, but it was just the icing on the cake. Ever since I got back from seeing my parents I've been breaking down, maybe it's because I finally opened up to my mom about some of the sexual abuse I endured as a child, I'm not sure. Anyway, everyday has been just hell. Constant racing thoughts, feeling like offing myself was the only way to cope, drugs, you name it and I've been there. Anyway, I got to the airport, went through security and arrived at my gate. As soon as I was about to board I lost it again, just broke down. Something in me was telling me what I was doing was wrong. After wiping away my tears I told the boarding agent I needed someone to get my bag off the plane and that I could not go anymore do to personal reasons, I then proceeded to break out crying again. But as soon as I left and I got back home my whole mood did a 180. It's so hard to explain but walking away just felt right. I haven't been this happy in a long time. I was so worried leading up to the trip about this and that and then having every bad memory from my childhood come up over Christmas, I was just in a terrible space. It's so wild toe that I can be feeling this good about losing all that money, not experiencing the world, letting those down who knew I was going on the trip, none of that matters because I finally know what it feels like to listen to your gut and intuition. I know that was probably all over the place but I'm sober and happy and feeling optimistic about life. I hope everyone here can find that feeling, lord knows I've been searching for it for a long time.  Listen to your gut I guess, anxiety can be your friend if you let it. everyone deserves happiness, just stick in there long enough to find it!",1
1194,"I haven't had any friends for 6 years. : I moved away from my childhood home 6 years ago due to my mom dying. Since then so much has changed about my life and me that if I talked to myself back then we would have no similarities. The closest thing to a friend I've had in those six years is my narcissistic stepbrother who I am desperately trying to cut ties with even though we live in the same house. I've met my old childhood friends many times but with each time I can feel how much more we've grown apart even though they are the exact same people I remember. I've effectively been locked in a box alone with my thoughts with no one to talk to slowly going more insane with every passing day for over 6 years. Even with everything that's changed I feel like every day is exactly the same as the last with the same routine. Get up, do chores and eat, do some school and look at my phone in my bed until I go to bed(and go to church for a religion I don't believe in two days a week). I feel incredibly isolated from society for various reasons which only makes me feel more alone. Ultimately I'm just waiting until I'm an adult and can start going out and making new friends which doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that that is several years away and I'll just be waiting for the whole time. Also I just want to add that I looked through the sub a bit before I posted to see if this fits and it just seems so small and insignificant compared to most of the other stuff here.",1

And now I dread school even more then ever now because I've fucked up a friendship up by being too emotional. I feel out of my fucking mind. What the fuck is wrong with me. I almost deserve dying.

All of a sudden my body was aching and many thoughts were going through my mind. I just felt really bad and I tried to push through it but I couldn't. It just got worse and worse throughout the day. I put on a fake smile and forced myself to get through the day because I had to visit family and I don't want anyone to know how I feel. As a matter of fact I don't want anyone I know to know how I feel. Which is why I'm here. I don't want to burden my friends plus I don't even know how they would react and I don't want to find out. Just going throughout my day I felt like I was alone because I am alone. Nobody ever texts to check on me or anything like that. I'm in groupchats and every once in a while I get a call to hang out. Besides that I'm alone doing my own thing. This girl I like confessed to me the other day that she likes me which is part of the reason I felt happy. I feel like she has no interest even though she says she likes me. If I want to talk to anyone including her I'm pretty sure I have to text first or call first. Which is why I believe I'm alone. I really don't know what to do. I'm conflicted and maybe even lost or confused as to what I'm even alive for. I feel like nobody even cares about me.",1

I moved to a new city a year ago, and like with me previous move, I am just at the point in life where it takes too much energy to attempt friendships. My biggest issue right now is the state of my living space. I can't be bothered to clean or don't care? I am unsure. I want to hire someone to help me clean on a regular basis, but I am ashamed to have someone see how bad things have gotten.  I think a better living environment would help but again i am overwhelmed. Should i just bite the bullet and not worry about them judging me?

I look at other people and think about how content they are in their life and how they have good jobs and are achieving their dreams and being creative and I just feel like I'm wasting away. I am smart and capable but right now it doesn't feel like it. I wish I could go back to being sweet and happy and almost effervescent but I am so depressed and I have no motivation. I have never felt so hopeless before.  My mood is so low that it takes so much effort to take a shower or attempting to better my appearance. I really don't know how men find me attractive. My personality isn't even there anymore for someone to like. It's just too hard right now to feel good about myself. I am so fucked up and it just feels like I'm broken beyond repair.

1202,"Issues respecting Women : I feel like I might be on the path to becoming an incel. I realize that this is unacceptable, and I want to change. I've just become very frustrated with women lately. I'm 21 years old, and I've never been in a relationship. I have had sex though. For most of my life I've been treated like I'm invisible by women/girls. My chronic singleness( I know this probably isn't a word) has really taken a toll on me. My parents lowkey think I'm game because of this, and they always ask me if I'm dating someone. My school has events that are mandatory, and most people  bring a date. I've never had one, and each of these weekends I've literally cried myself to sleep after or have gotten drunk by myself to forget about it. I do well in school; I try to treat people well( often better than they treat me); I'm in pretty good shape, and I'm an average looking guy. However, this isn't enough, I guess. I understand I'm not entitled to anything, but it's really frustrating to see literally everyone in a relationship(regardless of their character, looks, etc). I've been dealing with this since high school, and I keep telling myself that it'll get better, but it won't.  I've tried to fill this void by hooking up(tinder), which just leaves me more depressed and paranoid about my health. Just due to the nature of the job that I am going to have after I graduate, I really think I'll be alone forever. I think a life like this isn't worth living, and I've considered taking my life( but I wouldn't because it would devastate my parents). I've always been a introvert, but I've really started pulling away from society. I find myself becoming more sympathetic to incel ideology, and I'm scared. When I see pretty girls on Instagram or IRL, I just get upset because I know they'll never like me. If you read this thanks. Sorry for the rant, but I just want to become a better person.",1

1204,"What's the point of carrying on? I need to just die already. : I don't get the point of me continuing to live. I think I just need to end everything at this point. My life is a joke against me. The whole universe hates me, it's freaking obvious!From as young as I can remember, I've been treated badly by fellow humans. It started off with pinches on my hand, then those turned to slaps, then kicks, then strangling and the belt, then punches and hair pulling me meters across the floor. Then there was the constant verbal attacks that I still get. It's like I'm under a gunfire of insults constantly when I'm around my family. It's like I'm a disgusting person. Then middle school and high school came. I started to get bullied with the typical âyou're so fucking ugly f*gg*tâ?insults. Then those progressed to full blown harassment (physical intimidation, following me around, receiving anonymous texts with insults calling me every name under the sun and threats to get me expelled). Finally, I was basically expelled from school due to the principals son being involved in the bullying and how corrupt the school was. I technically dropped out of school before I was expelled, mainly due to the huge mental breakdown I had and the fact that I started to suffer from major panic attacks at school. I had to get my mother to eat lunch with me as I was physically scared to be alone, scared of what would happen. Then she stopped, getting mad at me and telling me that I was neurotic. Then I moved out of home at 16 due to being so unhappy there and rejoined school again after a year of being a flunk. I still had deep scars and as a result people saw me as weak and vulnerable so I started to get picked on there. I isolated myself before anything else happened and I was a complete loner. I put all my effort into my studies but didn't get the grades I needed for the university I really wanted to go to as one subject I took really, really messed up on writing the exams. Also, I was dumped by someone who meant a lot to me because I was ârevising too much and not spending enough time with themâ?and my grandpa died who was one of the few family members who actually cared about me. Then university came. It seemed like it was going well at first, until I started struggling financially to the point where I couldn't even afford bus fares. Then I got taken advantage of and sexually assaulted. Then there was an incident where someone told everyone I accused someone of rape and spread that I slept with that guy, which were both lies. Now I'm known as a sl*t in my dorms and I get really dirty looks from people because they think I'm an attention seeking liar too. To make it worse, the friends I made are distancing themselves from me and I have gotten very sick to the point where I've been in bed for a month. I got sick because the guy I was dating gave me a disease. This guy emotionally abused me, basically alluding that I was dumb as f*ck and that other girls were way hotter than I'd ever be. I broke down. I dumped him but he hurt me so much. Now I'm alone. I'm sick in bed. I was attached to a drip for 2 weeks straight. I don't feel like I have much going for me in life, if anything at all. I feel like I don't really have anyone at all and guys see me as prey and use and abuse me. What's the point of carrying on when the universe hates me? I should have ended my life by jumping in front of that train last June like I had planned. I'm ugly. It's horrible looking at myself I'm the mirror. I've lost so much weight from this illness and basically sleep all day now as this disease causes chronic fatigue. I should just leave this Earth now.",1
1205,"I just need to let this off my chest : My dad and I never had the greatest relationship. I remember when I was 6 I wanted a clean towel and he called me a bitch. He's called me a bitch a lot of times. He would also yell at me a lot. When I was little I would think he contorted to a monster. I would see his nose and ears get pointy, his eyes go beady, and his skin be red. I remember his facial expressions, how he yelled at me. He almost slapped me once.I played a game on his phone and lost. My mom had to hold him back. He always told me he yelled at me to make me tougher, since I was a girl. Every since 7th grade he's been nice to me, just because I attempted suicide. The amount of times before that I told him to stop, he never did. He's been trying to rebuild a relationship for 3 years now, but I don't see him as a father anymore. I want to talk about it with my brothers but they all love him. I have nobody to talk to. My dad just acts like it never happened. I'm scared of my dad, terrified when he gets angry. He cools himself down before he explodes now. But still I see his face contort. Because I don't see my dad as a dad, I have no father figure. I yearn for a father figure and it fucking hurts hearing people spending time with their dad. Is it bad I don't see him as a father?

My father had passed away my freshman year and I was looking for attention, and I was sexually assaulted right before my junior year and kind of went crazy (my theory is that I was trying to reclaim myself but really I just slept around a lot). We started dating right before senior year and now we're in college. I of course feel like absolute shit about all of this. I wish I could take it all back, but I can't. I tried to kill my self after I was raped, and at times like this I wish I would have succeeded. Maybe I deserved to get raped because I was being a hoe. God I just feel so horrible and I wish I could do something about it but I can't express that to him because I don't want him to think I'm pulling the suicide card to make him feel bad. Bringing that shit up genuinely puts me in this weird mindset and mood for a few days. I remember back when I was so depressed that I have a lot of lost memories and things that I repressed. I remember how I felt when I smoked weed every single day because it was easier to dissociate than to kill myself. I don't know what to do. He's a great guy he just makes me feel like shit when he brings this up. I feel like I regress back to my 16-17 year old self when this happens.",1

1215,"Why I want to sleep forever if I could, plus a rant about my life. : I don't even know how to title this. Not looking for sympathy, not looking for pity. Just wanted to post, journal, etc. Forgive me if this is not allowed as I am don't usually post, i'm usually just a lurker for content. I'm 27, turning 28 this year and for the longest time while I was younger I never knew what I was feeling, there was not a name, there was not a class, there was not someone like me to share this experience with. Now that I'm in the medical field and I understand/recognize depression more and it's like a ""friend"" or someone familiar that you know that comes around and ruins your day(s). Working out, going out, drinking, getting high, it all helps and I'm never depressed around people (sometimes it takes a little work) but given enough time alone I always fall back to being depressed. Sure, the stereotypical stuff, I've thought about how easy it would be to just not exist, how sometimes I just don't want to be here any more but I fear death and my rationale side always comes to tether me back to this reality. It's like I would gladly give up my life for something of equivalent exchange as whatever that was exchanged is most likely more cherished and valued than I feel of myself. I guess I just don't love myself.The worst part is that so many people have it so much worse than me. I'm sure I can list examples but if you found this I'm sure you can list your own. I have nothing to really be depressed about. I know, I know, mental illness, state of mind, etc. But I just feel so much crappier knowing that another human being (less fortunate or otherwise) living my life would have way less issues than I do and make something with the opportunities I have had. I'm doing well enough (at least in a socioeconomic level) that I should have nothing to complain about. Other than the occasional ""i feel depressed,"" I really don't complain. Maybe that's the issue, it's like I'm drowning but too afraid to ask for help.When I get like this I just want to stay indoors and watch crap all day, its not healthy but the time spent does take the edge off a bit. I find some solace in the things I watch. Donald Glover suffers from depression and you can see how his work changes over time to reflect some of that. Rick from Rick and Morty (don't judge me, I like the show) is a sad man that validates his existence by doing the crap he does to avoid the way he feels (season 3 Vindicators 3 and Season 4 the old man and the seat). In a way, it's healthy and good to know there are others out there, both real and fictional. It gives me hope that if they can make it, if they can work with it, however they do it, I can find my way.It's 2020, I just took 2 weeks off from work and I feel worse than I did before I took the time off. Tomorrow I go back, maybe working will help. I was really hoping I could relax and be refreshed for the new year. My girlfriend decided we should take some time apart and reflect on the relationship, I believe that'll turn out fine, I'm not too worried about it and would like to think we will come out better people after some time reflecting apart. The vapes cartridges I bought to curb smoking were leaking upon arrival (and taste pretty bad) but that's just money lost and expectations shot down. Small things, insignificant things never seem to bother me at the time, always seem to be the first things I fish out when analyzing what brings me to where I am now.I feel like my parents know better than to ask me about it. They're traditional, they don't really understand mental illness (or however you want to classify it) and I don't expect them to. At the same time I feel like their shitty kid. Short answers, not rude, but not inviting, and then retreating to my place whenever I can. We're not a traditional, ""I love you, have a good day, bye,"" sort of family, love is implied and unconditional; I know that. Does it ever seem like we're a burden? I'm sure we all have our roles and specific things we can offer to society, but sometimes I feel like people like me should be alone, like our emotional toll is no one else's responsibility, I'm honestly embarrassed by the way I feel or act.I read a joke a while back. It was a 4-panel comic about God and his creation (humans). The joke was that he made us with 24 hours in a day to do what we need to do, but we end up sleeping for 1/3 of that time (8 hours also the equivalent of 1/3 of our lives). The last panel said that it would be our favorite part: sleeping. Ironically I don't sleep well, but I found the joke funny. I just want to lay in bed all day. Honestly, I'm tired, I'm just so tired. I feel so drained putting up a facade that I'm perfectly fine nit at the same time there's not an emotional water fall to let out. It's like going to the restroom and not needing to go, but the stomach ache is still there telling you that you do. It's like I finally understand the ""feeling empty"" or ""a hole that never fills"" analogy in books and movies.  Laying in bed all day is such a huge waste of time, the whole day is wasted potential. But sleeping is the best, for hours at time you just don't feel this way. Watching things, facebook in bed, just crap to idle your brain so your brain doesn't hurt. I want to sleep all the time, but I have the worse time getting to sleep.This was a nice rant, I was able to smile and feel some emotions (choked up a little) that I otherwise would not have if I just went to bed. I don't expect anyone to fully read my word vomit riddled with grammar errors. **But for a TLDR: in responsed to the title just read the previous paragraph** but otherwise just a bunch of feelings that I decided to type up and it sort of helped me feel a bit better. Laying it out here is like having a person to talk to, except it's a public forum which makes me just a bit more transparent and less cowardice in expressing myself. Now I think I actually have to try sleeping. Thank you for letting me waste any of your time.",1

WHAT I DONT GET is i never picture myself jumping tho. just that absolute terror being on the edge. i know if i was sitting there now, id be so scared i wouldnt be able to move. i just obsess over the fear and the longing. why cant i even jump in my fantasies?? :( it's like i have this need to PROVE to myself that im not scared that i need to force myself in my daydreams to jump.",1

But just this past week, my ex started having conversation with me while we were packing so we could move out before the first (today). I knew we had to communicate but we didn't have to joke around, update each other, and just interact the way we did. it was completely shocking, and i didn't think it'd effect me so much, but it did. i love him so much, and talking to him like old times made me so incredibly happy but now i'm a mess. i feel like I've lost all the progress i made. he left on the morning of new year's eve without saying goodbye. i went to work right after he left and figured he'd be home by the time i was out. but nope, he was gone, he changed his number too so when i tried to call him about some stuff he had left behind, i couldn't reach him. this was all a big shock to me, i rang in the new year confused and in tears frantically packing and moving everything to my parentsâ? i don't know what to do. i feel terrible, i feel like i'm slipping back to feeling the way i did before. i think him interacting with me the way he did made me feel like he wanted to try to be friends, i don't know. i wish he had just left me alone if he had planned on leaving so abruptly.",1

1226,"Getting depressed over the new year : First of all I'd like to say I'm not diagnosed with depression, it's actually kinda rare I do get depressed. So maybe this is more of an upset feeling or something? Regardless, it's been getting to me. A few days ago making this post it was new years eve. I came home from Maryland to Pennsylvania for the holidays, and Christmas was nice. There was a small family party and I drank a little and made small talk and caught up with other people, then we all went our separate ways. Non of that bothered me. Then on new years eve, again I talked to the 2 other family members that showed up to my parents house along with me. We watched some tv, and it was nice again. But about an hour after everyone left and the house went dark I kinda just sat down and just started thinking. 10 years ago I was in 8th grade, was hanging out with after school, on christmas break, and was generally having a great time. Now I'm grown up, and dont really do much. I work, eat, do college work, play a little xbox or watch some tv, then sleep. Then repeat. Then I started thinking more how everything I used to have is gone. A lot of my friend moved and are gone, a lot of the shows I watched are off the air, places I went are gone, and places i used to go i cant anymore. Then it became clear how fast time went. It feels like yesterday I was on summer break, playing twisted metal on my ps1, my mom making chicken ramen in a pot, riding my bike up and down the street for hours, playing catch in the abandoned lot across the street, walking to my friends house to play gamecube, and standing out front of my house with my dad drinking a soda while him and his friends drank their beers. I started looking ahead after that. For my degree I'll be leaving country to work, most likely itll be around a 25 hours flight home then. So ill be leaving my home town further behind, so far to the point I cant make a week trip every now and then. More like a 2 week trip every year or 2 if I'm lucky. Not only leaving my town, also my childhood friends, family, house, places as well. My parents are getting older and people in my family are starting to die so I know that's coming. Its just.... wierd. I dont know if anyone else gets these feelings but this is a first for me. I wanted to go overseas to hopefully make a life there and have people from here come to visit and experience what it's like somewhere else, but it really really sucks knowing I'll be leaving my town behind. Even though it's a small town and theres honestly nothing to do and everything is really dated, its home, you know? My family's been in the area since the early 1900's and now here I am, feeling like I'm walking out on everyone. If anyone actually read this and made it to the end and has any advice or wants to talk, lemme know. My parents never had this problem, all my friends moved but not super far away, so they can always visit regularly, and my girlfriend has lived in like 7 different towns so she doesnt really understand the 23 years of attachment I have. I hope everyone has a wonderful new year, and if you do still live with family or close by make lots of memories and hold onto them, because you never know when that's all you'll have left of everything you once had.",1

1228,"The obscurity of my present : I miss what my life used to be like. Everyday, I wish it were like that. Because the way it is now, I don't like it. I may try to make the most out of it, but it is the way it was, the way it wasn't supposed to break down, that I long for. But it will never come. I feel like if certain things in my life were different, certain changes could be made, that it might help. Ultimately, my issue is so much has happened, a lot of which is adverse and should never have happened, so much heartache and heart break in my life ever since 2017, that I am just not sure what to make of it. My life before that, heck my life just over a year ago felt like it was closer to my heart. But now my life feels like this mess of things that I don't want. I don't know what to do. I just want to pursue the goals I had, do the things I used to love, and live by the meaning and purpose that used to reside inside. But then a combination of mental illness, past trauma, dysfunction, and bad choices on my part, as well as on the parts of others led me down this path. In my heart, I still want what I wanted. The path I was on. But I have no idea how I can ever get there. I have no idea what to do. There are even people that influenced my life that I have dreamed of contacting, but I feel like it wouldn't matter. That all the baggage of crap I carry will ultimately keep me separated from what I love emotionally, and render doing so pointless. Until all this crap in my life serves a purpose, until I find that purpose behind all this crap, why it happened, what to do with it, that way it can find it's place in my life and let go of me, I won't be able to proceed on my path and will instead remain a wanderer far away from home.",1
1229,"Robots : Just a thought. Life feels robotic. Living feels mechanical and draining. The ritualistic process carried from one day to another. Lately, the tampering sadness in me is starting to swallow me alive. Routines set for healthy habits turns into empty altruism. I feel empty. Listening to most songs can overrun my mind, bringing back the old cherishing memories I've taken for granted. I can't help but miss the sweet, simple childhood I've had but was taken for granted. Daring to reach adulthood only to feel at a loss with life and all it has to offer. I've only reached the first steps of adulthood but have never felt more strained and overwhelmed as each day passes. Forcing myself to get up, make the bed, and distracting myself through self-made chores have became numbly overbearing.

I am not close to anyone in my family, I don't want kids, I don't really have a dream job or anything like that, and I am not focused/talented enough to make art etc. The only real thing I had been looking forward to was being in a good/deep relationship, but after my most recent relationship collapsed, I don't really feel like I believe anything will work anymore. I've turned to random hedonistic pursuits to try to make me feel better, but really they are just making me feel worse. I don't know what I'm really supposed to do from here. I'm already on antidepressants, but even through them I feel this way- but I suppose at least I no longer want to die? I just kind of feel numb.

Yet whenever they do I feel worse and I push them away, internally I want that, but when it happens I feel pain. I don't want to die, yet I idealize suicide and I keep having endless threads of vastly varied scenarios of how would I go about it. Yet when confronted with actual death I fear it, and I do not want to die, yet I also don't want to live. I hate being alive, simply put. I don't want to exist.I have a Stockholm-Syndrome with depression, I absolutely hate myself and I hate depression even more, it ruins everything, yet it is literally the only way I know how to live, everything I perceive through my senses have to filtered through my depression in order to understand the situation, how to react, and what to do. At the same time, during healthy times where I feel better, I feel like I miss my depression, it's the only thing that I feel is real, it became a part of who I am, I feel comfortable in my circle of pain in it.And just recently, I've been extremely ill for the past month, about a week ago I started feeling better with physical symptoms. Although my depression has gotten extremely bad I started taking antidepressants and anxiety medics. Funny how my body took on the tradition of my contradictory mental state!Antidepressants are making me feel extremely apathetic, I don't want to do anything, I don't care. I don't want to hang out nor do anything aside from eating, and just staring into the wall. I don't care about anything else. Yet my anxiety is kicking in, causing me to always be alert and restless, so sitting down staring into the void with constant anxiety is annoying. The only way to calm this down is to do activities; which antidepressants are making me completely apathetic and I don't feel like doing literally anything. Amplify the anxiety with vitamin B injections, they're giving me a big boost in energy that I'm constantly moving my legs, arms, and just can't calm my body down, I have too much energy. I _have_ to do something! Yet I can't go walking, or driving (which would calm my anxiety and excessive energy), because my back is fucking itself with pain whenever I move and walk. And lastly, I can't hang out with friends and my SO:1) depression make me just want to stay alone, and Stockholm Syndrome makes it a bittersweet activity2) Anxiety and Vitamin B injections give me a constant need to _do_ an activity, thus sitting down with my friends is an impossible feat without constantly moving everything in my body. 3) amplify that with back pain, and the shortness of breath I get whenever I'm sitting down (the shortness of breath I probably blame on anxiety, because when I take my medics I feel more relaxed with it) SO NOW WHAT! I literally can't do anything yet I must do something, this is causing me to hate everything even more, and on top of that, nobody understands what I'm going through, they're just _You can do this! Don't be weak, you're strong!_ well have you taken a moment and thought maybe I don't want to do this? Maybe I'm extremely tired of constantly trying to and failing. I don't even care, I don't know, I'm just agitated at everything, and I want to die, but I want to live. Please, I'm lost, I'm tired, I'm hypocritical. please stop the pain",1

1245,"Venting : I was in a relationship for 4 years and it ended last spring. I'm over it. It was the most serious I'd ever felt about someone. We just mutually agreed to break it off and go other directions. She helped me realize I go through spouts if depression and I need to handle it. So I am. I think she cared about me more than anyone in my life ever had. And now that it's gone I feel empty. It's not one of those crawl back to her deals cause we just don't work together but now it feels like it meant way more to me than it ever did to her. Shortly after I moved out she literally got rid of all my stuff that I had to leave. I explicitly told her my mom would come get it and some of it I wanted to have shipped. But she literally acted like I never mentioned that and just disposed of it all. I for the first time since I was a teenager cried my eyes out. I cried so hard. She sent me $150 as a sorry like that covered anything. My shoes, dress clothes... all gone. It was so personal. She will never realize how awful that was to do and it kills me inside how easily she did it. She has no idea how that made me feel nor would she care. A few months went by after I moved out and she forgot my birthday. Didn't even say anything until a few days after. Yet on her birthday literally 3.5 weeks after I moved out I acknowledged hers. Once again this destroyed me. A person who told me 100 times they wanted to stay in touch and be friends cause of how close we've been for so long completely forgets I exist. These events have led me to resent her and I hate it. A month after I moved out she text that she was seeing someone. I thought wow... how fast. Then a few months later she fails to remember she told me that while texting me about some new dentist guy she's seeing. How he had a daughter near the same age as mine. Making comparisons. .... okay. Now I get it. It's easy to forget me and dispose of my things when you have the hots for a new guy. It made sense. And yet again I think on all the time we spent together and things we did and wonder why did they mean more to me than her? How can someone so easily dispose of another and be so blind to what they're doing?I've had the worst luck of my life since I moved away. I can't even begin. None of you would believe it. All I can do is shake my head and tell myself it has to get better. This many bad things can't keep happening to a single person giving so much effort and trying so hard to succeed. Surely it has to end but here I am. I feel resentment and regret towards her now. I don't want to. But it's the actions after the ending. To this day she never realize how much I sacrificed and gave up to be with her. That I never fully recovered from. My depression won and back then I didn't even realize it was depression. I wish I had never been in the Army either. That's something else entirely. Today after 6 years a friend told me basically I am just one of many. Said I'm not unique or special to them and said it in such a weird way. And I realized they were distancing themselves from me. What I felt about them was entirely different and I actually feel pain right now. Like I'm hurt and wounded. And I don't know what to do anymore. My childhood was awful. Being beat to finding out your step dad kept a child porn stash while his best friend was sexually abusing his daughters. I don't think I've ever told anyone about that. Just the beatings I took. My entire life has been violent. I'm disposable. I don't have any life long friends or people that check on me other then my mother. Today I have realized I am truly alone. Hoping the tide goes out long enough for me to dry out and catch something good or positive. Right now I'm stagnant and barely getting by. I think people use me until they're no longer satisfied then dispose of me. I'm not even on a self pity trip. I think it's just what it is and I'm coming to terms. I'll never have the balls to end my own life. I just can't do that. And sometimes I envy people that can. I don't need any âhang in thereâ?DMs or eye of the tiger speeches. I'm just venting. I don't have anyone to talk to or any way to give context of my life for anyone to understand anyways so I'm just saying what I have bottled inside. She could've said happy birthday.

1248,"Rant: Worthless Reflection of the Past Decade : Warning: Very Long PostLike a lot of people I suffer from depression accompanied by social and general anxiety disorder. Reflecting on this past decade has made me realize just how much of a pathetic spineless piece of garbage I am. Where I live seems to be crawling with loud extroverted people who shun those that aren't deemed social butterflies. Not to mention if you can't drive you must be ""mentally challenged."" I got my license at the age of 22 last year by the skin of my teeth, but my anxiety is so severe to the point where I tremble by the thought of driving. I can't hold a conversation to save my life, nobody wants to befriend somebody who is so social inept. My only friends are my mother, uncle, and most importantly my cat. I go skateboarding with my uncle once sometimes twice a week, I've been skating for about 13-14 years. I've barely made any progres within the last few years due to fear, it's not fun anymore, I'm thinking about quitting but I don't want to lose any connection with him.Through out the past decade I have just become more and more dysfunctional, I spiraled into alcoholism and drug abuse about 2 years ago, due to family conflict and my crippling anxiety. I have improved recently though. I've quit Celxa cold Turkey due to insurance issues, that was ""fun."" I'm sure this decade will be full of ""fun"" too. The sweetest being on earth(my first angel of a cat) passed away. A stray i was feeding was hit by a car, I knew the risks of feeding a stray, I was still upset. I went to bury him, only for this old asshole of a neighbor to come out and SCREAM at the top of his lungs that I'm ruining ""his property"" it wasn't ""his"", there was no grass anyways, just a dry patch of durt nothing, screams at me for ""fuckin up the lawn.""I snapped said some regrettable things to the piece of shit went inside, hit the wall, and drank some cheap shitty liquor all befor having my MOM drive me to work as a janitor because I'm pathetic. Seems like the only time I do speak I say something stupid. More has happened in the past I won't bore anyone else with my whining.So here I am typing at 4:00am about my life that I know ""could be worse"" but I'm just a whiney pansy.

1253,"Venting about a Wasted Decade : So I have no Idea how this post is gonna go, Im just gonna type it out and hope someone reads it.In 2010 I was in high school, had a few friends, was top of the class mostly. end of 2019 im an unemployed failure still living with his parents. I look back and I haven't done anything with my life. The friends I used to spend all night gaming with are long gone, Looking back I was little more than a joke to them, Just drifted apart when the conversations went from ""Did you play x last night"" to ""Did you F\*\*\* x last night"", was never invited out with them when we all got to that age so I shouldnt have been surprised. I thought I did well in my exams, got 2 Bs was very proud, first words out of my dads mouth where ""You could have done better"", From then on I was a disappointment to him. College I failed the first time, and got a pointless BTEC in IT that I didnt even want to do. and what did I do with that in the 3 years after I left college? A 2 week apprenticeship that ended when they let me go because I was too anxious to answer the phone.what else have I managed to do in those years? watch my parents get divorced? stay in my room for weeks at a time because why would I go outside. If I did I would only see people happy and having fun and that just makes me sick, also crowds terrified me so im not going out anywhere. Cant take up a sport, My body aches, I have no energy, It hurts to get out of bed cant do anything. I cant even sleep at night because Every time I close my eyes I relive all the BS that ive been through. I feel like my life is wasted, Im 21 I live with my dad, I only go out to Play warhammer and I barely say a word or talk while Im there. I cant talk to the guys there, what can I talk about? I dont have funny drunk stories, Or times ive done stupid things high or all the sex stuff they talk about and girls? never spoken to one in my life what the hell am I gonna say to them. Worst part is, I want to die, I used to hurt myself, but that has no meaning. I want to kill myself, just to die. but one thing stops me. I have one friend, Someone ive never met who lives on the other side of the world but I have the unfortunate luck of being in love with. and I hate it, because it means that I cant just jump off of a bridge.. So thats me venting, proably just being a stupid idiot but In my defence I havent slept in days, I have nightmares, too scared to sleep. I dont expect anyone to read this but I needed it off of my chest.. feel free to comment whatever if you feel compelled to.",1
1254,"I feel so lonely in my group chats. : My memes get ignored. Someone else posts a meme and everyone will laugh at it. I praise a show and tell my friends to check it out, no replies. Another friend praises a show and tells my friends to check it out, 2-3 of them will do so and explicitly praise it over the show that I recommended (like they'll literally say, âThis show is way better than (my recommendation).â?In another group chat I'm in, it's literally just a circlejerk of my egomaniacal SIL hosted by my brother (AKA her husband) and my cousin. Whenever I suggest something we should do together, it almost always gets shut down. âEhh, not really a fan of thatâ? My SIL suggested a card game a couple of weeks ago and they (especially my cousin) haven't shut up about it since. The other day, I think I was trying to spark up conversation and say, âOmg, did you guys hear about so-and-so?â?My cousin *literally* ignored my question and said, âI'm about to go pick up a deck of cards from Target so I can play that game!!!â?A few days ago, she told us about how she played that card game with her parents and how they really loved it. Today, she posted a screenshot of her dad asking her to come over and bring the deck of cards so they can play that game. And then in the group chat, they started making plans so we can all get together and play that game. Like, literally all we fucking do now is talk about that damn game and I'm glad that my SIL isn't in that group chat otherwise she'd love to see her ego being catered to.Now, my friend who was mentioned in the first paragraph doesn't have an ego, but he gets reassurance all the time which pisses me off because I never do in any of the group chats that I'm in. I ask if anyone wants to play a game together or I'll ask a specific person if they wanna play, I either get no response or a ânoâ? That's it. Usually, the specific person I ask is the aforementioned friend. He's the one who usually shuts me down or ignores me. Then I'll see him ask someone from the group chat if they wanna play a game. If they'll say, âI can't, I'm busyâ?â?someone else will reassure him and say, âI'll play with you!â?Why the fuck don't I get that reassurance? Why am I always the one left out? Why am I always ignored? Why are my recommendations always laughed at and criticized? Is it all just coincidental, is my taste really that bad 100% of the time or is there a deeper meaning behind their words? Why do I have to live and breathe in these circlejerks of group chats? I know the answer to that last one: because if I leave them, I know I'll feel even lonelier out of them than I do in them.Blah.",1

1266,"I'm a mess right now : I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.I don't know what to do to make myself happy.

Ever since I got the email of accusation, I don't have the spirit to fight anymore. This feels like it's it. I fucked up, I sabotaged myself and now I've pretty much ruined any chance of getting into medical school. I don't want to move, I don't want to look at people, and I don't want to be alone with my thoughts. I don't know if I have enough to keep going on. Everything looks hopeless.

1289,"Nearly a year into my gender transition: What I've learned. MtF : I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness. I'll never find love.",1

I've realized there is no one that would be there for me, never. I have vacations now for a month. After the first day I felt like nothing. I'm just something. Maybe a part of the nature. I mean I do nothing the entire day nothing at all because nothing helps. Everything is just boring and I don't feel anything. I have no one to rely on, every time when I start to make a friendship the people just leave me after spending too much time with me, I mean when they start to know me a little bit everyone left me. Or they use me. I'm getting sick of everything. People say things will get better, I'm happy that this is true for some people but it's not for everyone. I just feel like a shadow that no one ever notices. I changing my current state or emotions rapidly. Like the last time I played VRChat (a pc game for the VR, where you can wander around worlds meet other people and so on) I had fun but after one second it despaired and I was mad like hell for no reason. I feel like their are more minds inside my own mind. other kind of personalitys. I just want to end it all but I'm too weak to do it by myself, I see no exit out of this emptiness it got closed. I just hope everyday to die and to forget everything. Or to stop everything for a few years to take a break and get my shit together, but it's just too late. I don't even have a family that I could spend my time with, Not even a friend anymore, Not even anyone. Everything is just overwhelming and too much even there is nothing.

I work as an aircraft mechanic.The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life.

I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.And if I'm not happy?Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move.

1314,"What the hell is wrong with me / I need help... :  I just moved into my first apartment ""of my own"" at 33 (almost 35 years old) - granted it's ""section-8"" housing paid for largely if not mostly by the state specifically for people w/ disabilities - but that's beside the point...) ***ANYWAY***, I've got a big problem and I don't know how to get over it.I should point out that I've probably posted here before in preparation for this move (it took 5 months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here - so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar.....if that bothers you, just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with ""trolling"".Sorry, I got a bit off topic there for a minute. My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I've met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and ""say hi"" - which took a LOT of courage for me as I've got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.At any rate, so far I've met (or at least casually said ""hi"" and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a ""handful"" of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I'm signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can't find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that's coming from an ""uber-introvert"" LOL) or something like that - he didn't even want to offer up his name.Having said that, here's my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to ""hate"" me lol/smh):1. I'm admittedly somewhat ""bigoted"" if you will against PwD (""persons w/ disabilities"" for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A ""self-hating PwD"", if you will. It's NOT that I find anything inherently ""wrong"" or ""bad"" with PwD, so much as it is I'm so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because ""normal"" (for lack of a better, more ""P.C."" term) society doesn't want anything to do with us and ""God forbid"" they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.2. I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (***significantly***) ""below my level"" OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain's ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I'm not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn't have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with ""kitties"" (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That's like ***WELL*** over 50% of the people I've come across so far. And the ones who aren't impaired in those ways that I've met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment's average age I'd say is well over 50+ and I'm not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I'm obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should've tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn't figure out a good way to do so).Now, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can't bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with. For that matter, none of the people I ***have*** introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say ""hi"" in passing me in the hallways.I've thought about trying to find a way to ""get involved"" in the community *outside* of the building, but between my ""anti-social"" tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem I have with it, is there is basically only about a 3-hour window - maximum - that I want to fill during the **daytime** hours (roughly 12-ish to 4:45-ish, my shows start at 5:00).....including transportation, which having to rely on ""para-transit"", means I could spend most of that time waiting).And even that time I could probably spend catching up with shows I've missed that I want to see on demand. Basically, as has been the case for as long as I can remember, I'm a T.V. (and computer) ADDICT - and I'm largely okay with it, except I know it's unhealthy and antisocial. Ideally, I'd LIKE to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly I don't seem to *want* to get to know (and they've certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we don't have much in common, and she's already admitted that I'm a ""dick"" - which I already knew so I wasn't offended, the idea is less than appetizing. (NOTE: thankfully, she doesn't seem to mind that I'm a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one time and I never got her apartment number and I haven't seen her since).So to make a long story short - how do I get over my fears, and out of my funk, while still maintaining the things I enjoy (like surfing the net and binge-ing on T.V.) ? I'm thinking about volunteering, but the last time I tried (before I moved) I seem to remember those places always want you to volunteer - understandably, for a lot more hours than I'm willing to commit to.I'll end by saying (if anyone is even stil reading this ""TL;DR"" post at this point,) that there is no need to point out any sort of ""self-sabotaging"" or ""excuse making"" on my point. I'm well aware I do ALL of that, and I just can't get past it....in which case I'm afraid I'm screwed until I'm able to do so.",1

I started to drink alot of alcohol to try to minimize these attacks which it kinda does.The last week has not been very good because I got in trouble at work and I've been super stressed to go back which causes more head attacks and more drinking. Today I was supposed to work but I took 4 shots of whiskey before I went and my boss saw me and told me to call it a sick day because I looked too tired to work.There's some other details I left out because I don't want to type anymore but I'm just looking for advice on what to do.Thank you,1

All the things I liked doing, I dont enjoy anymore. I think all my ""friends"" hold a grudge against me, and i do not know what for.In person it would take you some telepathy to really see that there is something wrong with me. I've learnt to hide, as we all have. It hasn't been 2 day or 2 weeks or few months that I have had those kind of thoughts.Everyone I know has or is talking behind my back, I have heard rumours that I smoke, drink, use drugs, take steroids and a handfull of things that I can't begin to explain. I am only 17, my middle school was nothing but me being bullied or made fun off, being used or treated as trash. In high school I had a crush on a girl from my class, we were texting, getting to know each other n stuff.... Just how much do I regret ever noticing that this human being even existed, if i could go back and just skip the part with her it would be the best thing.My home aint a better place either, father is a drinker, sister is a little brat, my mother struggles to make ends meet since my father is a piece of shit, so I do my best to help with whatever I can. I am grateful that I have a bed to sleep in, though it aint always warm.. I am great I have food on the table. I am ashamed of how my home looks so I never have invited someone over.Solitude is all I know, I have become to be uncomfortable around other people, just because I fear someone would pierce or see thru the shell of the cool and chill dude that makes everybody laugh, and will see what a mess he is when he gets a little privacy.I am sitting in bed listening to sad songs crying my eyes out for no reason at all, I am really thinking about ending it all tonight. Tho I wonder will someone beside my mom and sister care that I will be dead? My abscense wont make a difference in anyone's life at all. Would anyone even care at all. My existence doesnt matter at all, and if that's the case why should it continue, why not end it tonight. I have promised my mother not to kill myself, but it is really hard to keep the promise.Have you felt like that? How have you resisted the urge to just end it all?",1

1336,"Life has been a roller coaster, and I don't know what to do : I've had alot of this on my mind for a long time. I just need somewhere to write it down and try to see if anyone understands. I've been through alot for only being 19 and my years before age 14 had alot of bad shit connected to it that im not 100% teady to talk about.  At 14 I finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and I taken by the state (again) and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. That alone was just a bad time. He called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that I caused it. Fast forward 3 months and I was told by my doctor that I have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. Fine whatever its just to check on things and I was fine after a week of rest. All they did was clean up scar tissue. However i had just started highschool and was in a junior ROTC program through the army. I was excited and wanted to make a difference that my POS father refused to. I loved this program it was my family and I made really good friends. I joined their shooting team and made it my goal. I got good, really good, too 10 in the nation good . My coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father I had. I loved them and I felt safe with them. A year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. He had missed something and thats why I was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at 16, cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so I wouldn't loose the ability to walk. Recovery for that was terrible. I couldn't walk, couldn't shoot, couldn't do much of anything. I gained probably 40 pounds over my 3 month recovery. I had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. It was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and I was finnally back with my family, couldn't do much but back. I remeber that night because it was one of the last times I felt complete. I was invites to another party a week after but I had to turn it down, my leg wasn't ready and I just couldn't.  I went to sleep early and woke up with over 100 notifications. Come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.I was shaken to my core. His back up driver was shit faced and killed him and it was all becuase I wasn't there. A month later I was at his funeral and we were able to give him a send off to be proud of, all I remember was crying. I had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. That excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't function. Both of my pillars just died within a month of eachother. I threw myself into shooting and my coach. He was all the support I had left. Fast forward 6 months to the summer. My surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and I could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day I rolled my car down a 30 foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. Once I was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. My coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic Jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. I loved that man with everything I had. He was all I felt I had left. He ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff,  they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. I was completely devistated, I didnt know what to do but luckily I had made one more friend that I could talk too. I got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. This guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to him. Flashforward to last month. He is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. I know he is guilty and being a victim of sexual abuse as a child I hate him for it. One of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend's daughter for years. Here I am now in college across the state and I am beyond lost with no true direction to follow. I want to go home and live closer to my family, but I am engaged and she is from the same town I lived in. We both want to move but aren't sure what to do. This isn't for pity I just really needed to get this out, thank you in advance for any advice.",1

I've struggled for 12years and been to ð©ððð© dark place BUT a tool that is phenomenally helpful is to spend some time and write a gratitude list, as long as you like. 1 point or 100. Start with something like ""I am grateful to have air to breath"" and go on from there.THEN Every day. Every. Single. Day. Write 3 moments of joy or 3 good things or 3 accomplishments or the day.Example 1:1. I got out of bed2. I brushed my teeth3. I am a healthy meal Example 2:1. I went for a long walk2. I applied for a new job 3. I completed an assignment You must do it every day for the benefits to last. And trust me when I say, the benefits cam be HUGE!

1374,"Choosing a date is so liberating : I thought long and hard about this. Very long. I've had 4 hours sleep in the last two days. In that amount of time I've come to the conclusion that no matter what I do, no matter how I fight my demons, or how much progress I make. I will never have what I want and need, never. I don't understand why I am being looked down on for making a choice. Someone once said that we all have choices, and we're adults free to make them. So, my choice is to not have my current life as I know it. It is so hard to explain to people what exactly I feel. I've tried, but what's the point? There's a million possible ways my life could turn out. Everyone keeps saying you know, you could be this you could live there or work here blah blah fucking blah. Like, I don't care if there is better days ahead. There isn't to me. I have my memories. And that is it. There is no better day to come because I have had them all already, not including some other major life events. I won't have them. I won't have children, or a house. Or a marriage, or a car. I'll just have what ifs and what could have beens. I'm not prepared to give up on what I, what we had planned. I'm just not. I mentally and physically cannot let go. I never ever ever will and nothing else will come close to them, nothing. I can't live a lie and I'm not sure I can continue on in the state that I am in. My entire life changed nearly a year ago. I've always been a bad person, with a flame inside of me. I worked hard and long to get that as little as possible, and under control. I really did. I was still flawed but the flame was at least manageable. But then fuel was dumped on it and I have not been able to put it out since then, And gotten to used to fuelling it myself. It's grown bigger than me.I've had my reasons to be on this Earth, I've had my goals, my plans, my purpose, my love.Had.Someone tell me, what is it your supposed to do when they all slip away and disappear? Just, 'dust yourself off' and move on? Has anyone considered even for a second that I can't, but more importantly don't want to move on? Time heals all wounds? What if you know deep down in your heart and fucking rotten soul that this, this path I have to walk down will not heal this? As I said, sure it might scab over but then I'd be an imposter. And I'd pick at that scab untill I'm old and worn out. I just can't do it.If I could fix the things I've done, I would. I just wish I knew how. But I can't. Some things are unfortunately permanent. So, the way I see it, I'll continue on untill that date comes around. I'll do everything in my power to fix my fucked up brain, to ask the questions I need to ask, why I'm like this, what could I do to change. I'll try to live a bit, do the right things, see beauty in the world. Except it would all just be hollow. And fake. Empty.But once that date comes around it's just the time for me. It's my time to make my choice.  I can't live a lie. I wish people could understand.",1

I know it's important and that, by not doing it I'll just create more stress for myself down the line (exam season in May/June) since I'm essentially sacrificing 20% of my grade.  This time though, I feel like the depression has finally won. It's decided that it's not going to happen and that's just that. I can't see the point in trying really anymore. Yet I'm still bricking it over handing in unfinished work.  Besides that, I tried to phone up my GP to get an appointment to talk about depression and get a diagnosis but as it turns out I'd moved practices to somewhere not near to where I currently live. I don't want to reveal to my grandmother (I live with her) that I'm depressed, but I also need her help in getting the documentation I need to register to a new practice and get a GP so I can finally have an appointment and speak about my problems.I've also had an argument with my grandmother  about it because she thinks I'm asking too much of her and I'm just rushing. Since she doesn't know why I'm going, of course. Just ughhhhh. I just want this all to go away. TL;DR Everything seems like too much effort, depression has consumed me.",1

Most of the people have lots of friends, go out with them, have fun. I'm literally blocked and I don't know what to do. My parents saw my history in the PC about my depression searches and asked me if all was ok, then Just ignored everything like It was Just a phase and everything could pass. They putted me parental control on my phone to see what apps I use at what time. They want me to study like they used to do but I'm not like them. I don't care if they used to study a lot and don't go out, or if they used to study tot time a day. I don't even care if ""researches"" tell that you Need to study tot time and without distraction. I want to decide about my life. If I have to make a mistake even a terrible one I want to do It by myself. Parent's shouldn't block parents from doing mistakes like they do but to show where there Is an error and tell the son wich Is for them the right decision. Then the son have to decide to do that thing or not to do. I'm not talking about taking drugs or things Like that which obviulsy have to be stopped but about everyday life. At home I have parents that want me to study, treat me like a children and don't understand how the world has changed since when they were young. The excuse Is Always ""I'm older so I'm wiser"". Problems with parents are something really terrible but that unuckily many teenagers have to face. I have problems with people of my Age too. I'm a 15 years old nerd. I love Star Wars and science fiction in general. I love videogames. I love tech related things. I'm ugly and I have glasses. I'm not fat at least but you know I think I already have my bad things. I hate the fact that I like myself and I don't understand why people have to be judged from what they like or dress. I hate fashion and I don't have any single Nike or Adidas shoe/cloth. I like talking about videogames and to dress as I like. But people don't and I can't change people. I don't have no One with I can talk about star wars. Or Who can play some kind of videogames with me. I have a friend that I know since when we were 2 and we did only primary school togheter but After middle school and now High school we still are very related. We are very different for some things and very similar for some other things. He studies a lot, loves classical music and plays 3 instruments. I study normally/bit under the normality, I listen to EDM music and I love videogames that he hates. Tho he Is the only One Who Always tells me that he Is here to help. But I don't tell him everything because I'm scared of disappointing him. And when I try to help him he's One of the One that tells ""It Will all pass, I'm here"" . But as I said I don't tell him everything because I'm scared of disappointing him and because he doesn't have time. I tryed to relate to someone else too ending not in a really good way. I really like this girl in my class (She obviulsy doesn't like me) and I'm Always thinking about ""what if I ask her if she likes me and She answers yes"". One girl in my class understood that so I told her about the girl and we started to talk. The funny thing si that she is a middle school classmate of my friend about what I talked before. She Is incredibly intelligen but she Is really popular and has lots of friends. She Always try to help me as She can but obviulsy She can't relate. She has Boys that write her on Instagram ti ho out with her and I can't even talk ti my crush. She has lots of friends go talk with. She tries to make me feel special but obvusly I know I'm not because if Tomorrow I'm going to die She my maybe be sad 1 week than continue her life. She tries to help me telling things Like that I have to react, to ""change"" for the others and that all Will pass. All Will pass. Not because she Is evil but because obviulsy She can't give me what I Need. I Need now a total best friend like the ones seen in movies, someone at what I can tell everything, talk about everything. And I fuckin don't know what to. My best friend is someone I love but I can't tell him all. The One I consider my girl best friend (unrequited by She) Is too popular too intelligent and have to many friends to treat me like I would love. My crush isn't even looking at my. My parents don't understand. I Just want to go to school revealing to my crush with She telling me ""I don't look at the exterior but at how you really are"". I Just want to cry desperately with the girl I consider my bf telling me ""I know you are not ok. We Will become really Friends now because I understand you"". I Just want to be able to cry and to recive help instead of telling ""I'm ok"". Everyone asks if it's all ok, and I want to Say ""no, I Need you help"" but I can Say Is ""yes"". I know that nobody can understand me, when I write long letters like this, when I feel depressed and I'm sad. The worst thing of being depressed Is that people expect you not to be depressed. And I'm going Crazy. I don't have a real friend Who understands me, no One I can talk with at 1000000%. I Just want to cry but I know I can't because I know my girl best friend Will Just get angry with me because I'm not ""reacting"". I Just wanna die but I know my parents Will be devastated and that everyone would Simply thing ""he's so stupid, everything can be solved everyone can find a solution"". Why can't I Just die in peace.",1

I just am too scared to tell them because it's so hard for me to be optimistic about anything.

Two years ago, I looked up depression quizzes, just so I could see I was being silly, but each time I got severe, I then tried again yesterday, and got the same answer. I know they are not definitve, but to get severe depression about 6 times has to mean something, right?  But as I am underage, I don't know how to bring up the idea of therapy without insulting my parents (making it seem like I don't want to talk to them) or costing them a lot of money.

I feel like my friends make my depression worse in this way because when I reach out to them during times of crisis or when I want to vent about something, I'm often left with half ass replies or no replies at all. It sucks to be someone who is always there for others and to not be met with that same compassion. This in itself makes me want to isolate myself from my so called friends because their distance and lack of concern for my well being makes me hate myself and my life more. In short, every time I'm at my lowest point I'm met with the reality that no ones cares about me.

Yesterday my family celebrated my father's 60th birthday, and my father seems to be depressed about it. My mom and I tried to get him to do something with the family, but he said that he didn't want to do anything over the top. So we agreed on going out to dinner just the three of us, however as time approached he declined saying that he had an upset stomach. He has done this before in previous years but he would go ahead and have dinner out anyways. This year though was different. Even when trying to figure out what to get him as a gift, he kept telling me that it was fine if I didn't get him anything. Of course I got him something that he might enjoy, but the entire day seemed kind of dark. When accepting his presents he said that the last 20 years have been the best of his life, which seems confusing to me. If the last 20 years have been great, why aren't you optimistic for the future? This morning before I left the house to go to class, he had stayed home from work. When I asked him if it was because of his stomach, he said that he was just in a funk about being 60. I asked what he meant by that, he said that he felt that he didn't deserve to be 60. I am still trying to figure out what that means. My father isn't really one of those forever young types, which makes me wonder why he feels the way he does. My mom will be with him all day today so I am sure they will talk about it, but I am still worried about him. I believe that he thinks he is a burden to our family, which is absurd since he rarely needs help from any of us, and refuses recognition.  I am worried that by trying to help him, he might get worse since he thinks that would mean he would be more of a burden on me and my mother. What should I do?",1

1424,"I feel stuck in my own self. : Hey all, first off I want to thank anyone spends their time reading this, theres so many things anyone can be doing and you choose to accompany people online who need it. Thank you, I appreciate all of you to no end for that. Im posting this because I don't feel like anyone I know would want to hear this.I just plain hate myself, and I feel stuck with being myself. I feel like others look down on me as a lesser person, like a guy you just wouldn't want to spend time with. By expressing these feelings, I get the thought that it only predisposes people to think I really AM a lesser person. Of course I mostly keep these feelings to myself, both because of that and knowing that most people dont want to be brought down by others weight, I understand that. So I keep these feeling to myself and try to be the best person I can everyday, and focus on self improvement and social skills. But despite this I have trouble making new friends, while my existing friends seem to always slowlydrift away from me. I cannot tell what is my own confirmation bias about what people dont like about me and what they actually dont like about me.My last group of friends I had I had to cut off, after realizing they  were not the best group for me. What made me realize this is when we all planned a road trip. I had told them day 1 when we made the plan that I would not be able to drive because my parents didnt want me driving on a trip as far as we were going. 2 Days before we planned to leave. The friend that was driving me couldn't go anymore, so I was without a ride. The 2 others driving both had 2 seats open each. But said I couldn't come along because ""They just dont want me in their car"". It made me feel super left out and crushed, because the others in private would say it was all childish, but none would actually speak up for me. The 2 driving would say ""Just drive anyway who cares what your parents say"" as if I could just disobey my parents like that. What happens when I come back if I did drive, you know? I can't just disrespect the rules of the house I live in, besides they had a total of 4 open seats. Much more than enough room. They then proceeded to try and make me pay for my room for them still. If anyone reading knows anything about hotels, you are more than able to call and change your plan to stay there such as one less room etc. The friend who booked the hotel had confirmed this and gave me my money back(in private), while the rest of the group thought that I was an asshole for taking the money from my room back (even though they canceled the room).So since then I havent spent time with them becuase they all clearly didn't want me around. And few that felt it was wrong didn't care enough say a word in my defense, despite the open seats and trying to extort my money for my room that they could refund.I have since felt very depressed, instead of having a group to hangout with every weekend I now spend 9/10 days alone in my room thinking about the friends I once had, convinced Im just some asshole whos incapable of knowing right from wrong. Too introverted to put myself out there and make new friends. I've never felt so alone in my life. My very loving family that I'm thankful for, is really all that keeps me going these days.",1

Sometimes, I really wish I had someone I could wholeheartedly trust and talk to. It's not like I wanted to be ALONE intentionally. I tried all I could to make friends. I wasted a couple of years trying to be nice to my fellow classmates when I was in school. I was always there to help them be it with money and effort. I thought they cared. I thought that for a very long time but everything was a lie. They always neglected me. Whenever our class teacher gave us any group assignment, they would always exclude me but be nice to me from outside. They were using me and I was letting them do it. It really disappoints me even to this day.Most of those so called classmates even bullied me so badly during school days that I still cry to this day. They humiliated me. I was even physically beaten by few of them. None of the teachers that I complained to believed my story and took action against them. It has really MESSED UP my brain to be honest. This feeling is really weighing down on me pretty heavily these days. Over the years, I've developed depression and anxiety. I stopped being social because no one cared. My social skills are so degraded now that I'm not able to speak properly to anyone irl. I stumble, hesitate etc. My mind often goes blank or I say the wrong thing unintentionally. I've become a zombie.There is no one that I can talk to right now. My parents don't understand me and I personally don't want to be a burden to them any longer. I'm already unemployed and eating off their savings while sitting comfortably at home. I keep myself closed inside a room for most part of the day doing random stuff on the internet to seek pleasure. Even when I sometimes try to socialize with people, I find myself not having that good old vibe anymore. It's like I want to avoid every social situation. My condition is pretty bad and is worsening day by day according to me. I try to change but quickly backslide too.I wanted to add more details of how I messed up my life but I won't since it already seems long enough and I really don't want to waste anyone's time with this stupidity.

He had one before as well and i should have acted right away... so it wouldn't get so bad. He was crying and I repeatedly but calmly asked him what's wrong and what happened, after a few attempts he finally said âCan i kill them?â?

But they try to forgive him anyway but i also understand why they've resent him...)))))Before you judge him... please...don't say anything yet..After this i texted him over and over again about how he shouldn't do stupid shit like this and how he should never make a decision or action while being completely out of it. I told him that it's going to affect every part of his life for the worse and that i didn't want to surprise visit him in a cell... after that i called him again and again until he picked up but he quickly ended it. I decided that i shouldn't call him back because he'll get angrier and he won't cooperate with me if he's angry. Luckily, he asked me to call him again and i did.. this time he told me that he was going to kill someone and then dropped the call. Again, i texted him what i had to say..

He said â?i want you to come here...â?      ((we are currently 3hrs away))         i said i wish i could be there with him and that i really wanted to. He said âThen come here.... i'll give you 10 secondsâ? I said âNo, that's impossibleâ?and he said âokay...â?then ended the call.   ((That's the end of it so far)).    I've been around people with depression all my life and i have depression as well... i can some what imagine what it must feel like even if it's a little bit.. what we both go through are different though...He sounds like an asshole..The actions he does are indeed cruel and the words he says are also unforgivable.... But this is a boy that needs help, he deserves help... i can't and i won't abandon him... He's all alone and it seems like no body is willing to help him âfriend wiseâ? his family might not know about this.. He's suffering from within and it's becoming physical. I want to help him get professional help... i want to tell his parents.. i want to go there... i want him to get better already... but how... i want to be there with him too... I love this guy so much and i know that he's been so beaten up that's why he has such a bad reputation but there were always times where he tried... he tried to redeem himself... but no one was willing to give him a chance... i understand why... i really do.. But after we were separated from each other (LDR because of financial reasons) He was really trying his best to get his shit together with what he had....He couldnt take LDR so we broke up.. but we still spoke to eachother.. One day we spoke about not talking to eachother anymore because he talked to his aunt about his future.. We both agreed to focus on our studies until after college. I prioritise his future, health, and happiness so that's why i let him go..But now after this interaction. I just can't sit back and do nothing anymore. He is clearly in so much pain and no body is even helping him. His parents are having such a hard time with life as well but they might not be aware that he's getting this bad....and i bet he didn't say anything to them because he didn't want to be a burden anymore. The poor baby...I have an idea of what i should do it's just i need comments about this whole thing.. i'm not unsure about if should i help or not.  I'M GOING TO HELP. Not immediately, or maybe immediately... i don't want him to go insane, i don't want him to lose agaisnt depression, i don't want to sit back and watch as he struggles to hold on to life and his senses.. I need suggestions and comments about this... Ask me anything and i'll try to answer each of them.  I will tell if i can't reveal certain information. Please help me... before it's too late. I can't act like this is all bluff... horrible things always happen when people decide to ignore someone in need of serious help.",1

It's quiet around here, I took a quick walk around the building and everything felt strangely calm. The air is warmer than usual and it's starting to feel more like spring. Everything felt good about that, and yet all I can think about is how empty everything feels. Life feels so vacant anymore at this point. My job has no real purpose because I just fix technology, and technology doesn't exist when the power is off, so in that case I'd just be some guy with nothing to do. I want to feel useful, or like I exist for a reason, but instead I feel trapped due to safety. My job is safe, and my anxiety prevents me from reaching out of the comfort zone.

Every day. It's easy for them. It's a part of their routine. And on top of that, they are chasing their dreams. Getting their degrees, promotions at work. Pursuing relationships, starting families.. Things they can actually be proud of. Accomplishments they can share with others without feeling shame for being proud of themselves. Right now I feel so fucking pathetic that cleaning my kitchen made me proud of myself. I imagined telling my mom how I cleaned my kitchen and that it made me feel proud. How absolutely pathetic I would sound to her. How disappointing her daughter turned out to be... I wish I was nothing. I wish I could evaporate.

An even larger part of me just wants to hide in a hole and never come out. To clarify, the decision isn't what's at the root of this depressive episode. To be honest, it's hard to distinguish my general unhappiness  with our relationship from everything else. It's also hard trying to make the decision to leave a good person, albeit a lazy one, for what feels like no reason (but there are reasons). I hate that I feel like a nag for asking for something to be done, especially something they need for themselves: like making a dentist appointment. I hate living in clutter (and that's hard to keep up with when it's not your stuff), I hate the excessive drinking and nights out late after work. I hate that I've been the only one to cook, buy groceries, clean the bathroom or kitchen in months. I hate it, but I dont know if that's just because of my mental state or if I've always hated it. Really, this is how it's been since we've been together.We've never so much as argued with each other.

My bf has never struggled with mental illness or known anyone with mental illness. He's not good with emotions and doesn't know how to help.During my last episode, He asked me what I needed and I initially said I required time to think about it. Therefore, he concluded that I needed to get some distance and I was bumming him out. I explained to him that that was a really bad thing to say to someone with depression. His next approach was for me to explain what was upsetting me and he would go through and debunk them. I explained that this was a bad approach. After all, I know they're irrational. I don;t need someone telling me my thoughts were dumb.Next, he asked what logical ""12 step program"" I wanted to use to get better. I told him that sometimes you can't logically explain emotions. He said ""well can't you do something to take your mind off things?"" I said ""those are coping strategies. Sometimes they don't work."" At this point he was frustrated. I find that this is the norm with people who are uneducated about mental illness. They have good intentions but ultimately say something kind of insensitive, try to approach it with logic and then get frustrated when it isn't an easy problem to solve. They do get sad but it's fleeting. They can talk themselves out of it but we can't. They have difficulty understanding why we can't just ""get over it.""At this point I gave him some suggestions: Allow me to talk about my feelings without being judgmental. Try to understand how I'm feeling instead of offering logical solutions. Hug me and comfort me, show affection. Spend time with me, don't leave me alone. Mainly, show me that you care, not that you want to fix me. I just need support.We spent the day together and he made sure to support me. I felt a lot better by the end of the day. I appreciate that he even tried to help me initially. He had good intentions. I think most people do. They just need some guidelines. Mental illness can be really hard to understand. I understand that these guidelines might not work for everyone but it worked for me. It's made me feel more supported and helped him feel less lost :)",1

Nothing is generally wrong but I kinda just go in autopilot a bit if I can't be daydreaming if I want to be, or get irritable. Essentially I'm addicted to day dreaming (3+ hours a day) and I think it's causing this high functioning depression, where generally I'm okay and have good intentions for my life, but living in reality full time exhausts me to the point holding a job is difficult or keeping to certain commitments because I feel like I need to day dream and of course that leads to a lot of stress and lack of stability. Is there some kind of special behavior therapy for this?tl;dr: I think I'm addicted to day dreaming and believe it's what is causing these problems of being a normal functioning adult in my life.",1

1486,"No Reason to be depressed (18M if that matters) : Not a fan of word vomit, so i'll try to keep this concise.  I live in an upper middle class family ( only child if that matters) and I was the typical introverted ""smart kid"" throughout elementary school. Hard work wasn't needed to achieve stellar grades. Middle school fucked me over tho; it was a new school with new people and I was far out of my element. Compounded with my lack of work ethic, this took a toll on every aspect of my life. I've felt useless ever since. But, all will be detailed in the following. In preschool ( age 4) I didn't have control over my anger, so when someone annoyed me, I would hit them. The teachers, obviously, didn't like that and told me not to hit. Needless to say, kids my age didn't really like me either and I became anti-social, eventually entering elementary school with sub-optimal social skills. Although my violent tendencies slowed in elementary, they didn't stop, and, more importantly, neither did the incessant guilt that followed. Keep that last part in mind. At age 5 I started Taekwondo. I only did this because my one of my few friends did it as well. Like most martial arts, there is fighting element called sparring. I HATED it. I was conditioned to NOT hit, which is not ideal if you are trying to fight someone. So, when they hit me, I didn't know how to handle it and I cried. I was not only self conscious of my violent tendencies that I repressed them at all costs, but I was also humiliated in front of everyone whenever there was a sparring class. I think you get the message. I wasn't very social, wasn't good at anything useful and I felt like shit because of it. Now back to the present.  Just, barely, graduated high school and I have no direction in life; grades were shit so I'm not going to Uni and I have no energy to look for a new hobby or passion. I'm TRYING to fix my diet and workout but its extremely difficult. Nothing matters anymore, I think about suicide everyday. I even tried it once. If, for whatever reason, you want to know more, I'll happily oblige. P.s : Sorry for the haphazard nature of this post, its my first and I'm experiencing some brain fog atm. Normally I'm a pretty good writer ( and public speaker for that matter)",1

I've been depressed since I was 11 or 12, I'm 17 now. There have been highs and lows and especially now it just keeps changing. I could be happy for a while only to get really depressed for the while after. I've noticed I've been getting really dark âI would rather be deadâ?thoughts lately, something which I haven't had in a long time. I used to cut myself but I stopped and I don't feel the need to do it again but sometimes it comes into my head and it makes it worse. I've tried antidepressants (setraline 50mg) but I had to stop taking them before they fully kicked in because I couldn't function in school. But without them I can't function at school anyway because everyone seems to annoy me and I just would rather be home in bed asleep.I've also tried counselling more than once but it didn't help. I couldn't seem to open up at all and at the last therapist I seen I started crying because of how uncomfortable I felt because I couldn't open up, I wanted, even needed to talk to someone and I was pushing myself to do so for weeks but it didn't change anything.I find that odd though because I seem to be able to open up with my friends, depends on what type of mood I'm in but I would always at least say something about how I was feeling.I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know what to do but I just want it to stop, I want to be genuinely happy and to stop all the shit that's in my head.Sorry for this, needed to rant to try feel a better.",1
1490,"I think I have depression but idk : I (M17) keep telling myself that I'm fine and I'm just tired but I haven't properly enjoyed anything for a while now, about 2-3 months. Any activities have been fun at first but get boring very quickly. I like to just sit in my room and not bother with anything, not bother to be happy since it's not worth the effort.I also get constant compelling thoughts to self harm. I've done so by scratching my arms a few times because the thoughts just take over and it's the only thing that makes me feel better. I've regularly had thoughts where I see myself hanging in my room.I have exams coming up but I'm not feeling this way because of stress. In fact, I'm not stressed about these exams - I don't care at all. That's just how it's been. I don't care about doing well. I don't care about getting good grades and having a good future. I haven't been motivated to do anything and I always feel like I'm letting someone down.Even when I do briefly enjoy something the thoughts just flood my brain again. It's like there's no point in life for me.My parents know I've self harmed (they found out about a week and a half ago) and they think it was stress related. They also think I haven't self harmed since (not true). One of my friends from school also knows and he checks up on me regularly to try and support me in any way he can but I just don't feel any different once he does tell me.I don't want to sound like I just want sympathy, I just wanted some advice on what to do next if it is depression.

I feel like I should suffer as much as I can I did research to painful deaths (thank you bing) and got oddly intrigued by this one way of suicide. I don't know what the proper term for it but it was someone to be placed in a boat and have half a boat on top of the other and have the victim stripped naked and put in this boat. To where their limbs and head are the only thing sticking out as people would put honey and milk on them. Letting bugs and other stuff get on them and eat at them slowly from the inside out.

When I'm depressed I wake up on time, I do my work like I'm supposed, I smile when talking to people &amp; engage with everyone like it's all good. It's like I go into autopilot where I do &amp; say what seems to be the right things while inside all I want to do is not exist.It's been like that since I was in high school. Whatever happens during that time good or bad just doesn't matter. If something good is happening Its like I'm a piece of shit that can outwardly seem to be enjoying themselves but on the inside I'm not so my mind says I should just disappear if I cant enjoy the simple pleasures of life, on the flip side if someone sad happens outwardly it seems like I'm taking it well but on the inside I feel dead. Which leads me to hate myself because I'm suppressing whatever emotions  I should feel.I honestly dont know what the point of this post is but I guess it's just to say that I frustrate myself &amp; at times feel like I'm just doing life wrong. I think I deserve happiness but end up back at this same point where I wonder if life is even worth it, its honestly tiring but I know tomorrow I'll get up &amp; try again.

I'm currently one of (if not) the worst in terms of marks in school. I have a strong PC addiction, mostly playing 5 hours on school days, and up to 12 hours on weekends. I find studying nearly impossible, I just, I cant get motivation to study.Worst part is that I've been feeling nothing but sadness, and I have been finding myself repeatedly deciding on which is the best way I could end my life. At this rate, suicide for me, is just, inevitable.I recognize my problem, and I want professional help, I want to go to a psychologist, but I come to the truth that **psychologists do not really exist in my country**. A quick search of google maps reveals no real psychologists, and to add insult to injury, depression is usually very neglected in my country. If I reveal my depression, the first response is to say ""you're a spoiled kid"". My family is likely to travel to europe in 2 months, and I want to seek help there, but I simply cannot get money as a 15 year old in order to pay for therapy. I'm not even sure if I am allowed to go to a psychologist alone. I simply cannot tell my parents that I'm suicidal, I just, I cant, I dont want them to intervene, I want to solve this without them, it would be humiliating for me.I always question my self - why am I really here, why cant I just leave?I've already decided on a method of suicide, and it will probably happen within a year at this rate. I have no value in life, nobody likes me, I'm not good at anything. I'm just a useless observing rock that consumes resources.I love you, mom. I love you, dad, but I just cant take this anymore.

When i was 13 years old my back then girlfriend who i was really in love with killed herself by hanging herself and i have ptsd since that. I was in contact with a couple of therapists but i dont think they can help me. When i  was around 16 i found another girl who at the time reminded me of myself and i fall in love with her. We had been together for 9 years but i started to threat her badly at the end i dont know why i did this but i did. She became clincal depressed because of me and i could not see me as the reason behind it. She left me around a year ago. I have to say about that that i have extrem social anxiety and dont leave my appartment at any time only in the mornin at around 8am when i have to buy food. My mental state since that has became worse and worse. I started taking drugs and drink alkohol on a daily basis because i cant deal with being responsible for her state. A couple months ago i started to cut myself and had 2 suicide attempts by taking 100 painkillers the first time and around 130 the second time. Right now i am back home from a long walk thinking about jumping infront of a train. I work a deadend job in a office where everyone makes fun of me on a daily basis and i have to pretend that everything is fine or else they fire me because i used to almost get violent against my coworkers when they started to tell me i do this for attention and that there is nothing wrong with me. Every single day of my life is constant agony i wish i would just die. My daily life outside of work consist of playing games and taking drugs/getting high to keep me distracted. On a weekend i spend around 16-20 hours a day on my pc watching series from my childhood and while thinking of better times.

1525,"How do I know if I should seek help : Around January last year I started to feel really down and lost most motivation I had going in life. I was a straight A student and always had such a strong drive to do well and within the span of a few months everything came crashing down for me. I lost all motivation, could barely get out of bed in the morning and either felt apathetic or just sad. I rarely genuinely laugh anymore and my happiness feels like something I project to the world rather then an actual feeling. I went through a few periods like that before everything fell apart but it never stuck around except the summer before for a whole month I just went apathetic. Since then it's just stuck around, sometimes it's easier and I can manage but some days I can barely make it through the school day without being on the verge of tears. I knew I had some mild anxiety problems before that so I just blamed it on that but it feels a bit different. Honestly when it started I resorted to sh, sometimes for stress relief, sometimes just to feel something. I'm a few months clean now but the pressure has been getting overwhelming and it's hard not to again. Ive gone through periods of drinking to make the feeling go away too but I've been staying away from that so far. I've started skipping classes really bad and occasionally just not going and telling everyone I'm sick cause it just feel awful. I've been told it's just teenage hormones and shit and a bunch of other stuff but when I go on here and talk to others with those issues I feel I share similar feelings but often for them it's cause of depression but as for me I don't know. I don't want to be one of those cases where I just seem like an attention seeker or such or like I'm overreacting I'm just not sure what to do. Is it a possibility?

That isn't an invisible anvil dangling above our heads; it's the entire universe, always ready to pounce and take us out. Or just knock us down. Or even taunt us.

I'm a stoic buddhist and I'm well aware of the natural contrast life gifts me to accept and grow out of; Darkness is, with a sparkling accentuation,  just as beautiful as light with some dark emphasising spots, as long as the intensities swap! I'm no fan of overly optimising myself and certainly not others, I just live by what my spirituality opens up and what I learned from 7 years of psychotherapy wich helped me to work on compulsions and past-depression. But here we are. As I constantly got more confident with myself, let go from my manifested illusions about social media, never drank alcohol again and being generally more physically and artistically active in the past few months, I lost a lot of friends, but as I am positively aware of changement and as I don't want to cage them as thoughts in my head and give them the space also in real life, I went on and thought ""This is absolutely okay, it might be interesting when you some day meet them as they are a totally different person or you see them with different eyes by then!"" I stopped smoking and then a big part of my clique broke away, same thoughts but they were a bit questioning this time... I tried to motivate my friends to go outside as almost everyone just smoked pot indoors and I felt really tired (not by the smoke, I always left when the room got too cloudy) when hanging around and just watch some movies. I decided to search for cool places in the woods where they could hang while being able to smoke and maybe experience some kind of ""wildlife"" adventure. They really liked it! But it got boring soon I guess so we ended up again indoors. I decided to look for new people, maybe a whole new constellation could bring some dynamic into my life and motivates the core part :)But then my best and last friends felt betrayed and I got no luck meeting new people in my region as they all think I'm too weird. Also I don't like going into clubs where there is loud and disturbing electronical music ... I'm deeply alone now, also my parents and siblings don't want to talk to me as they can't understand why I converted to buddhism. I simply can't constantly meditate to achieve wisdom on how to feel social fulfillment without ever talking to anyone.

1569,"Wasted $25k online gambling as an 18yo student - desperate : Greetings,  I never talked to anyone about this and never shared my story anonymously, but here I am, for the first time. Since I was little, I wanted to make money out of everything, and at like 13 years old, I discovered online gambling. I managed to get an account and start gambling, and the biggest problem is that I won in my first gambling session. I didn't win big, but for me, as a child, it was a great amount. The days after I won, I kept gambling because I was fascinated by the roulette, and I ended up losing all my money saved as a kid - around $150. It was a terrible moment in life for me, but I managed to hide it from my parents.  Later on, I kept placing small football bets because I was watching football, and it was more entertaining to watch a match that I placed a bet on. In time, to get the same satisfaction when watching football, I was placing higher and higher stakes. I ended up losing my $2000 savings in one day at 16 years old.  When I turned 18 years old, my family decided to support me and offer me a considerable amount of money for my studies - around $30k. I never told them that I had a gambling problem. I knew that it would be a bad idea to get my hands on such a significant amount of money, knowing that I have a gambling problem. Long story short, I lost around $20k in 1 year of gambling, I had highs and downs, but now I am down, and I don't know how I will manage to pay my rent, food, and so on. I am secured for the next four months, but then I am not sure what I will do. I wanted to suicide a couple of times, but I didn't do it because that would be the easy way to end things, but only for me. My family has put all their trust in me, and they believe that I will succeed.  I am a very social person, and I can say that I am the right person in general, and I always try to make people happy. I am dead inside, I can't fulfil my daily tasks anymore, and I am not sure if I'll manage to pass this semester because I am spending too much time overthinking and feeling guilty. Sleeping became my favourite activity, but nowadays I wake up sad, guilty, and I think about death every single moment when I am alone, all by myself. My friends and colleagues may be noticed that I am not okay because I am often being asked ""how are you? How do you feel? Is everything okay?"".  The main problem of a gambling addict is that we can't share how bad we fucked up. We keep it all with ourselves, and we are afraid to see a professional because we know that we may be judged and not helped instead.   I sincerely regret wasting this precious time of my life in such a way and having to face the consequences of gambling. My mental health is terrible right now, and my physical health gets worse. I can sit in my bed all day, doing nothing, not even eating, just overthinking and feeling guilty. I never fucked up so bad, I love my parents, but I can't tell them what I've done because they save this amount of money in many years of hard-working, and they wouldn't understand me, I am a shame.  **The only advice I can give from my personal experience?**  Stay away from gambling. Not even one penny, not a single bet. Do what you're supposed to do. I regret not telling my parents in time that I have a problem and that I wouldn't be able to save and spend money wisely. If you have an account on a gambling website, I suggest you self-exclude yourself forever, for your good. Even if you win, you'll end up losing later (most likely). You know, easy come easy go. STAY AWAY FROM ONLINE CASINOS (AND ALL CASINOS IN GENERAL, BUT ONLINE CASINOS ARE MOST DANGEROUS). **What am I going to do next?** The most significant gift that I can offer to my parents is finishing university. I am a first-year student, the first semester has been like a rollercoaster for me, but I managed to pass the first semester. Now, I am in the second semester, and I want to give all my exams. This would get me back on track; if not, I don't even know what I'll do with my life. Yes, I struggle a lot, I struggle even with eating, I had days in which I didn't eat anything and didn't also feel the need to eat. I want to be able to study and make my parents happy. I don't deserve anything even though I have (had) everything I needed. I want to be a normal happy person again. I am desperate.   That's my story, and it's a mess.

Also because I don't want to be a bother. -Im having intrusive thoughts, but I know that acting upon them is wrong because, although I feel different now, there are some people who love and care about me. And I don't want to hurt them by hurting myself.I really don't know what to do with myself. I'm doing my best to stay optimistic because I have just a sliver of hope that the future will bring happiness.

Maybe a couple years, but when I look back at what I felt like back then it seems to pale in comparison with right now. It's been getting worse and worse of late, by the day, really. For the past two or so weeks, however, it's been worse than ever before. I feel like I've fallen into some hole that's getting deeper and deeper around me.

Or smoking weed and then eating disgustingly unhealthy food. But I hear the same advice over and over that exercise and good diet are the two best things you can do for managing depression sans medication. I don't know why I'm writing this out.

Ever since I joined hostel my life went upside down. I started alcohol, cigarettes and heck even drugs at times. But the pain and the thought of ""you're useless, a burden, a nobody"" just won't go away. There are voices in my head which tells me that I'm wrong. I'm bad. I'm meant to be sad and feel shit all my life.Since last year, I've been suicidal and you know the worst thing? I can't even talk about it. Mental health is taboo in my country. If you speak about it, people take you up for being retarded or just an imbecile. I prefer not to speak about it for that reason. Not family nor friends. I dunno what to do too. I'm no more happy. I have HS finals in April but I still don't have the ability to get out of the bed and open my god damn books. It's like I'm stuck. I watch movies, everyday and watch cartoons of Batman or Superman to keep myself up. And honestly, even if this sounds weird or obnoxious to some extent, the only reason why I haven't roped it in is because I think Batman wouldn't have liked it. The problem is that I don't blame my parents for having sex one freaking night and reproducing me, I don't blame society to put me up with this shit. I don't blame anyone. I blame myself. I hate myself. I hate myself so fuckin much that it's to the point I can't, I just can't handle it anymore. Since last year I've been planning to do it. Rope it in. I don't wanna live anymore. It's just too much for me. I'm so bummed out by this disease that I've even managed to push away few good friends who were genuine to me. I feel like an asshole but you know, I think it's for the betterment of them not to be with me. I have had crushes on soo many girls but let's face it, it's futile. Even if I managed to befriend one of them, I would just end up scaring them away with my depression.P.S : I just wanted to open up about this.

1595,"Failing grades : Hello everyone, I'm new to Reddit (in an attempt to seek help and advice) I (18F) have struggled with the feeling of underwhelming sadness for about 3 years. The reason I don't give this a title, such as depression, is because I haven't seeked medical advice or been diagnosed - so I don't feel it's appropriate to diagnose myself. But I do believe it may be a case of depression. I didn't enjoy school due to lack of understanding particular subjects and feeling I was more behind than my peers. The only subjects I excelled in was Art &amp; Design and English. But despite even that, I was so unmotivated to do it and I could've really hit the high grades if I had tried harder and studied before exams, something I didn't do. From a young age I took to a passion for Aviation. I remember flying for the first time and being absolutely drawn in to the industry. I remember my flight being delayed for 2 hours and the entire time I had my little face pressed up against the glass over looking the Airside area, fixed to the activity going on below and taking it all in. My ambition was to be a flight attendant. After finishing school at 16, I got a place in my dream college. A college specific for Aviation. It was a long way from home but I managed to make it work. I'm still attending now, this is my second year. And this second year is what I would like to address in this passage. The issue is that I am behind in my work... extremely behind. I have no other excuse than myself for this. I'm going to try and explain this the best way I can in the hopes some of you guys may have been through similar, if not the same thing. I absolutely love the subject I am studying and I'm very blessed to be attending and have a seat in the class. I still very much wish to be a flight attendant, so it's not a case of not having a passion for learning. I want to learn. I haven't lacked motivation in that area, but where my work is concerned I just cannot do it. It's not a case of not understanding, because when I do eventually get around to my work, I believe I can do it well. I just cannot bring myself to be organised, motivated and work before the deadline. Even after my work is late, I simply cannot force myself to address it. It's like a weight that holds me down in my bed and convinces me the work can be left. I don't know how to describe it. I can't be organised and do my work in regular intervals to ensure my work meets the deadline. It's like a constant fight between my heart and my head. I hate disappointing my tutors, which have been so lovely to me, however I have not spoken to them about how I feel. I feel guilty and ashamed when I walk into college without the work they have been expecting or expected. I want to be successful in my course but I'm proving not to be, and if I'm unlucky, I worry for my place on the course. Sometimes the paperwork doesn't make sense to me and I cannot understand what is being asked of me. I am extremely sad about this because I work outside of college and I am a good, understanding and hard worker. I'm better at practical work than class-based. I believe I could be a successful flight attendant, given the opportunity... but I'm worried I will not achieve the grades to get there due to these issues. Please help with any advice? Thank you",1

1611,"Could someone help me understand this? : I feel so numb. I'm 20 years old now and from what I can remember, about half way through secondary school (14/15 years old) I started to change. I started not wanting to be around my friends anymore and gradually reduced my friendship group until it was just me and someone else. I started not wanting to go to family events and I just wanted to stay in my room on my own. This horrible empty feeling gradually increase and surrounded me wherever I went.I started to forget simple things that before I could easily remember and do no problem. This ruined my confidence entirely and my motivation and drive for things I enjoyed doing just didn't exist all of a sudden. It's as if everything I previously enjoyed doing or had any interest in wasn't worth the time and effort.After the last years of secondary school I went to college and studied to become an electrician. At that stage my mind was blank so I just picked the course because I knew I had to do something. I met a guy in my class called Callum and I was brave enough to tell him what had been going on in my head throughout the last few years. To my surprise, he related to some of the things I need saying and eventually told me that he was trying to figure out a way to tell his parents that he's 'not feeling well'. I looked in to it and found out that a lot of the things him and I had talked about had a chance of relating to depression and anxiety, at which point I thought I'd try and gather my balls and tell my parents.After crying, stumbling over my words and snotting everywhere, I managed to tell my parents that I'm suffering, to which, in a nut shell, they responded with ""ah you'll be alright, you're still growing so your emotions will be all over the place for a bit"". Considering I explained in pretty good detail that every night I'd pray that I'd die in my sleep, I was pretty confused that they didn't understand me that well.So after this shitty story of how I started to realise that I may have a dark brain, I ask this. Any of your guys and girls out there that do suffer, would you be open to share some of your stories so that maybe we could understand a little bit more of how things build up?

1625,"My Life atm : I don't even know where to begin. I was always a very antisocial kid, which made it very difficult for me to get friends. In primary school I had almost zero friends. The only people that spent time with me were also the ones that bullied me the most. In secondary school I gathered a couple friends, but when my depression kicked in and my grades began to fall dramatically, they made fun of me and left. At that time I had minor heart problems and I made a big fuss about it just so I could get myself to become home-schooled, because I didn't want to see anyone from that class again. But my plan failed and I still had to go into class to take the exams, which I didn't. I lied to my parents and went to the city I was studying in just to smoke some cigarettes and return home without doing anything. And it made my parents happy because they thought things were finally getting normal. It worked for about 2 months, but then the principal contacted my parents and I got expelled from the school. Everyone saw me as a huge failure, including myself. At that time I had a couple online friends who helped me carry on, but the last one betrayed me last christmas and since then, I barely had anyone to talk to. About a month ago I met a guy online and we developed a really close friendship and he introduced me to some of his friends, which made me happy. I got along with them and one day he introduced me to a girl. We clicked immediately and fell in love with eachother. But there was a little bit of problem. We live 300kms away from eachother. But apart from that things went along really well. Until like an hour ago, when she told me she didn't feel really well. Turns out she hasn't eaten in 3 days, because she had some personal problems which I'm not going to go into. I tried convincing her to stop starving herself. About 30 minutes ago she asked me to allow her to hurt herself in another way instead of starving. And now here I am writing this post, while smoking my 6th cigarette in a row and already 9 shots in. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be part of any of it. Everything seemed so perfect and now I'm just afraid of losing the one I thought will finally make me happy...",1

1627,"Oddity where I can breakdown then act completely OK afterwards for family : Today my therapist forced me to look at the reality of how I was doing mentally. She weighed me after commenting how skinny I have gotten and I found out I went from 115 pounds in September to 92 pounds as of today. I completely broke down into sobs, hyperventilating trying to tell her that couldn't be right the number had to be wrong. She just gently rubbed my back until I stumbled off the scale and she held my shoulders in place. Before that moment we were talking about past family events,  I started to cry and panic. Like child like sobbing almost, I hate to say it but like a kid. In this session, after going to her for three years I finally broke down, in total three times over an hour session. But when my mom picked me up after the hour, I was fine, almost hyper even. My mom didn't seem to notice, so I tried shoving back what happened in therapy into the back of my skull. Which worked for awhile, I was able to be chipper and comedic, and everyone bought it. But once again once I was alone in my bedroom, I became overwhelmed and for the past hour I've been pacing and sobbing. But, like before with my mom, i was able to placate I was fine with my grandmother and step dad. I feel like there is something seriously broken within me and that no one can fix.

1630,"I sorta beat social anxiety and now it created a bigger problem : I (16M) suffer from mild social anxiety but it used to be worse, so as a coping mechanism to not knowing how to socialize I make jokes, and a lot of jokes roasting myself in sometimes extreme manners, as I always do things. It made me less of a ""loser/loner"" and more of a ""regular kid"" which is awesome for a teenager, BUT.As I said I make a lotta jokes about myself, and people think that they can too, seems logical, yet it isn't, I can't take it, people make fun of everything I do.

1631,"I'm a new mom and I want to end it all... : Dear people of Reddit I'm planning on killing myself today, for a little bit of context the man I had this baby with we were together for about three years we're not together anymore. I am asexual (which means I don't enjoy sex in any way shape or form) my ex oftentimes would force himself on me. but on this rare occasion (when my daughter was conceived) I did agree to have sex with him however, he came in me without my consent. (I'm not really sure if you'd label that as rape or what all I know is that it's wrong) I'm 23 now he's 24 I've gone through a lot with this man and even though my family is absolutely in love with my daughter. (My parents especially they're in their mid-50s now and poor as hell) and I can't help but feel that by having my daughter I placed a financial burden on their shoulders even though they would never say it I know that I did. the worst part is there was nothing that I could do to stop it throughout my whole pregnancy I was forced to watch my body distort and change into something I never wanted it to I never wanted any children. I also can't help but feel like my ex forced me into this position as if to say ""hahaha now you can't get rid of me."" (I was having issues with him before my daughter was conceived) I'm also having problems with his family, his family harassed me for over a year they did all sorts of things to me including forcing me to stay outside in freezing cold weather with nothing but a bathrobe on and no shoes for over an hour. Now I'm scared that one of these days those racist morons are going to find my daughter or at least find out about her because of everything that I went through with that family I'm afraid for her safety. Overall I just want the pain to stop. Every time I look at my daughter I can't help but feel like I was taken advantage of like the role of mother was forced upon me. Something that I never wanted to be I was forced into. Even though my tubes are completely severed I still can't help but feel this way. irrational thoughts that flud my mind that say all anyone was ever born to do, is to reproduce and die. So Goes On to the Next Generation and it worries me that I have a daughter it scares me to think that some day the same will happen to her and I don't want to be around to see that happen to her. it absolutely infuriates me that Evolution has left women with such a disadvantage. Because unlike men women don't have the option to pull out, women can't just check a box and say ""I don't want to have kids."" we have no choice in the matter ultimately as a woman it doesn't matter what you want. all that matters is what your body wants, I can't take this anymore I just want to end it all maybe in the next life I'll be lucky and I'll come back as a man at least then i'll have an option  I hope I do.",1

1634,"I've always heard ""go towards the pain"" : and I got frustrated because I could never understand what that meant. I felt like it was preventing me from getting better. It was metaphysical and way too watered down. It is actually a process (another word I need to get into in just a minute) of asking yourself exploratory questions about your behavior and feelings in areas of your life that cause you sadness, pain, anger, frustration; the things you see and the situations you're in that cause you to feel those feelings (details later).The ""process"" just means that it takes time to discover these areas in your life and then untie the knots in your feelings and thoughts. There are nuances to your personality and thinking that have been shaped by years of experiences and your interpretations of those experiences. Those interpretations can be forced onto you and into you by your surroundings, you can be guided to certain interpretations based on your surroundings, but your mental archives, your individuality, goes into this hand in hand. Discovering all of this in yourself and getting it organized and many other faculties of this ""process"" take time. So going towards the pain doesn't mean ""sit with it"" like I was always told. That sounded to me like, ""if you have a migraine just sit on your couch and 'try to really feel it'"". It really means recognizing the things that stir negative reactions and pain and maybe cause trouble and suffering in your life; truly asking yourself (like a scientist would ask about something that happens in nature, ""what causes an avalanche?"") WHY does this trigger these uncomfortable emotions? What's is REALLY behind it? WHERE did I hear it? WHO did it come from? What has happened in my history that sparked this? What ARE the nuanced experiences? The list goes on and on and each question sparks numerable other questions that could be explored because we all think we know ourselves, but we don't have a clue. In this process you are slowly learning your personality and experience much like you might slowly learn someone else's personality and experience by watching them and their mannerisms, what they talk about, their stories, what they like, what makes them sad, angry, what makes them laugh. You are learning your pain (and much more in the process). Imagine you couldn't locate the exact position of a wound on your body. I don't know why but imagine all you feel is this stabbing pain that you can't locate. It's maybe hard to imagine but that's kind of the point. This process entails that you are blindly exploring for answers from this pain in your life's experiences. In reality there isn't a location of the pain in your lifetime as you have lived it. It isn't a wound that a doctor can point at and correct for you. You're blind and stuck at the bottom of a dark, dry well with a broken femur and a doctor is at the top of the well trying to assess the damage from a distance and shout instructions down to you on how to perform your own surgery. Even if it's a success you'll have months of physical rehab to get back to where you were before your fall. That's a pretty metaphore describing a condensed form of what is really a very long and sometimes rigorous psychological process of discovering where you and those wounds are. Once you've really figured that out; after years of bleeding, festering, and spreading infection through your life; you can finally begin cleaning these wounds, bandaging them, and actually start to heal. *This is an accumulated conclusion after years of  reading about psychotherapy, psychology, self-help, and visiting counselors for my own struggles. Because I've just barely realized this, I know I'm only at the beginning of the process. I hope this helps accelerate someone else's.",1

1636,"Wasted 5 years of my life in a pointless degree. : TLDR; Sort of recent graduate with psychology degree and computer information technology degree that is having a hard time finding a job, and doesn't know what to do. (I wrote an essay down here so here is short version so you dont have to read me rambling) Hey everyone. I'm really at a standstill. I graduated almost half a year ago, with a bachelors in Psychology and a minor in computer information technology.  I started off my education enrolled as a computer science major and did 3 years (out of 5) under that major until I started failing and dropping classes. I know this isn't the forum to really post about this, but around this time period is when I started to get major depression which made college much harder, and made me re-evaluate things in my life.  It took a while, but after talking to counselors and taking some psychology classes under my science requirement for the CS major, I was more motivated to switch into a major that I was doing well in, and could possibly help me understand my problems; as well as I could see myself wanting to help other people in the future. The problem was that I switched out of my major very late into college which meant that if I kept on taking above average college student course work (I went to a college with trimesters), I would graduate in 2 more years realistically\[1 extra year to normal 4 years\].  I finished in my calculated time, but with me pushing myself really hard to finish in those two years; I didn't really have much time to do labs and get experience under my belt. I was luckily able to get my CIT minor fairly easily since I took so many computer science courses while trying to aim for the major. My current situation is that of a person with a lot of undeserving privilege.  I moved back with my parents, and have been doing basically nothing but wasting my time playing video-games and such. My parents are both very well off and have no problem of me living home rent-free and they travel so much that they barely notice me. But, after being a slob for months. I am feeling that at 24, I am wasting my life doing nothing. I want to find a job, but am having in incredibly hard time doing so. My resume is very, very empty as I did nothing worth putting in it; other than, dishing out $100,000 + on a piece of paper, and that I am fluent in Spanish. I have a little bit of programming experience, but after doing nothing coding related for so long I have honestly forgotten a lot of it. What can someone like me do? Should I go back to school locally (luckily a good major university is in my city)? When I switched majors my GPA damage was already done. I was at a 2.2 when I switched out and with 2 years of mostly B's and A's (some C's on the way) I was able to get myself up to a 2.9 (so close to a 3!) so grad-school is probably out of the question as most programs require a 3.0 to apply and even at that, would not consider someone with a low 3.0 and no experience; and unfortunately psychology is a field that mainly requires at least a masters to get a decent job. I want to take charge of my life; I'm really tired of not doing anything. I would even be willing to do something that doesn't pay me at this point just to get some type of experience worthy of a resume. Many of my less-privileged friends are working retail jobs to support themselves but I am thankfully not in that situation. I just have sadly not found what I want to do with my life. Today was a world of emotions but  thankfully I am in a better/ more hopefully head-space writing this.Hopefully someone has had a similar experience and can put out of good old' redit-ly advice.

I just want to know what's the longest someone has had it... on average how long can a person endure the pain and hiding it from others. I miss being happy and I miss all the memories.

1639,"(17M) I give up on making friends. (Long post) : My life has really been on a complete downwards spiral ever since I was 10 years old. When I was, 10 everything was perfect: I was involved in sports, band, had a best friend and many other friends. Let's go through a timeline of what's happened to me since then.11 Years Old: It's the first week of 5th grade and all my friends have left me for no reason, including my best friend. I sit alone all the time during lunch and walk around the field doing nothing during recess. But I assume these people that no longer talk to me are just immature and try to think that they were taken out of my life for a good reason.12 Years Old: Middle School has started. Yeah, I'm still alone all the time. I try to keep that same attitude I had before though.13 Years Old: I pulled out from the public school I was going to and decided to do an online homeschool program. Getting up at 6:30 AM five days a week and spending 7 hours a day at school doing work I could do in 2 hours felt pointless, because I was getting A's in all of my classes and had no friends to hang out with. Oh, and my parents got divorced this year. Lots of fighting right in front of me and lots of having to choose sides in certain situations. Definitely great things for me to see and great situations to put me in.14 Years Old: Really nothing this year actually. Still okay doing online schooling. Still no friends though15 Years Old: I'm still okay doing the online homeschool program because I know that being a freshman at a public school will be absoulte hell for someone like me. However, I finally try to get out there and make friends. I join my local homeschool group with expectations that there will be some like-minded kids that I can hang out with sometimes. I thought that I had no social skills after having no friends for years? It was sad to see these kids try and talk to others. I was the biggest extrovert there (and I'm an huge introvert). I made no friends with them.16 Years Old: I'm desperate to find some friends. I go back and forth all summer with the decision of doing online school again, or going back to a public school for the first time in three years. Fear defeats me and I decide to stay homeschooled for another year. AWFUL DECISION. I spend the entire year sitting in my room crying and questioning why I'm even here on Earth. 17 Years Old (Now): I have to go back to public school now. I do. I try to find a friend group. I sit with so many different lunch tables during the first few months of school I can't even remember everyone I sat with. I'm not welcomed at any table. I don't fit in at any of these tables. My social skills are flat out embarrassing. I'm almost ready to just give up on ever making friends in my life and just accept it as a fact. Three weeks ago, three kids randomly started hanging out with me everyday at lunch. They were so nice to me. I thought it finally was over. I felt happy for the first time in a long time.They cut off contract with me two weeks ago for no reason and now walk past me without saying anything to me. When I asked them why they did this, they said, ""I don't know"" softly and walked away.This is why I've been crying all weekend, and especially today. I give up now on making friends.",1

1655,"I just need to explode! : Anyone else try to act like a normal person, just going through some shit, when you try to talk to your friends to just feel some relief; then they just reply with something like ""yo! Me too"" . . .  And your left there like ""ok sure let's talk about you"" and suddenly your turning into your friends therapist. You find yourself telling your friend that you cant their significant other did that while Internally your dying but in a weird way it is a relief b.c you were distracted from the legit nothingness you feel inside. I hate when you even tell people you have depression and you suddenly get ""omg same me too"" and once again your hearing about their problems. Then you have nothing to respond with because in reality you have no problems and no reason to be depressed.  You just are. How do you try to explain to someone that you cant handle the tight feeling in your chest, the loneliness, the desire to break down, freak out and end it all when you have no reason to feel that way. My life is great looking in. I have a great job, I make good money, have an amazing boyfriend.  I could use some more friends but that stems from my lack of getting out of the house. So what the fuck! Do I feel so fucking aweful.  I spend my time in the shower crying so my boyfriend doesn't know. I love to cook and am all about taking care of the man who takes care of me all the time but when I feel like shit and cant think straight I make terrible food and bless his heart he eats it. I burn everything because I cant focus. I just space out b.c when I'm zoned out I get a moment to feel nothing at all. I love that moment.  I just feel so bad when I try to talk to someone cuz yeah anyone else I'm talking to does have it worse than me. I'm like yup your life sucks. You win.  While I'm just miserable and for no reason.  How do you talk to someone in a generation of who's life is worse. I just want to die. I'm so alone u work hard and for what? Theres 100% no point.  I could do less work and just make enough money to get by but my work is my escape. It's the one thing that forces me to get up and excel at something.  Then it ends. I come home, walk my dogs(thank god for them, for being my reason to literally keep going when I come home from work) then I shower cook have about an hr to myself and i do again everyday is a distraction so why the fuck am I living ? If everyday is just another day successfully lived then why do it ?? It just doesnt make sence. As far as suicide... I'll be honest I have FOMO. What keeps me from ending it is the thought that one day I'll be ok. One day. I do well at work b.c. I push myself to distract myself and I'm good at it so why!!! Cant I push myself into something productive outside of work. I try to workout but I dont want to be without my dogs. I try to work out at home but I just end up curling into a ball on the floor and crying.  Idk why either. I just feel awful all the time. Wtf is wrong with me. FUCK!! Thanks for letting me get that out.",1
1656,"Am I depressed? : I haven't had a diagnosis but I just feel so damn awful every day. I don't feel happiness and I feel like there's a constant darkness following me. I don't enjoy anything I used to, and I only have enough appetite to each once a day usually. I don't want to socialize with anyone, and in turn i get these intense feelings of loneliness. I'm lucky if I can fall asleep before 5am and even more so if I get more than 3 hours of sleep. Ive taken half a bottle of melatonin with half a liter of 100 proof moonshine in the hopes that I don't wake up the next day. I think about suicide almost daily and how I could cut my wrists and if I decided that I wanted to live I could go to the hospital. On the days I can manage to get 7-8 hours of sleep through multiple sleep aids I feel tired the whole day. I have constant reoccurring nightmares, some that are lucid that I can't escape and find myself screaming in the dream to wake up. I've take up cutting my forearm with a safety razor and it makes me feel better for a little bit, but it's a fleeting happiness. I tried telling my mom but she said I'm just vitamin D deficient.",1

1661,"I feel like my existence is a lie to others : I'm in a weird situation and this is just getting worse. I'm known as the upbeat guy who gets amazing marks all the time, especially at school. Everybody thinks I'm so confident. But in reality, I'm 16 with no clue what I'm gonna do with my life, even though there's so much I could do, and I can't find a purpose in life, be it my own or life broadly. I'm entering a fifth-to-quarter-life crisis and it's severe.I carry so much baggage, from the times that I harassed people in elementary school and early in high school for living their life a way that I personally couldn't understand, ranging from how they dressed to the language they used and so much more.I've also been diagnosed with OCD and while it did basically ruin the 2015-16 school year for me, I've managed to be pretty open about it and that aspect of my mental health is doing better so everybody thinks that I'm fine and stuff.But in reality I can't find myself. I'm ashamed of my inability to figure things out. I even made an alt account on Reddit and turned on a VPN to avoid being traced because I don't want anyone to figure out that it was me who posted this. Nobody would understand my pain and I don't want to be a burden. I also feel like my childhood, as it starts to draw to a close, has been a waste, since I've put in so much effort for these marks and yet I don't even know what to do with them, and as a result of all that effort I've put aside time for family, friends, and a social life in general in pursuit of some numbers on people. I have people who I talk to and stuff at school and joke with and smile with and it all seems cool, but I haven't formed any bond that I could take out of that academic setting. I've literally never hung out with anybody outside of school during my 2 and a half years at high school.

I'm struggling so much with my course and don't know how I'm going to cope in second or third year if I can't even do well in my first. I dislike my flatmates because we never go out as a flat which means I never go out despite really wanting to and rarely have an oppurtunity to drink and just enjoy myself with other people. Everything is just getting to me and I'm scared this is the start of another downwards spiral because this is the worst I've felt since starting uni (and uni has been a massive positive step for my mental health for the most part).I don't know why I wrote this out but I just have. It feels good to rant.,1

1665,"Life is just so fucking pointless and I just want to die. : I can't kill myself. The image of my dad hearing the news and crying is already enough to prevent me from ending it.But I just don't want to live on anymore, I'm so fucking tired. Exhausted from worrying so much and not knowing when it will end, if it will even end. I catch myself nagging a lot to others about small things. Might be the weather, people at work or whatever else but it just happens. Even if I text with friends I'm on semi autopilot and I'll start bitching and the only solution is to just not talk/text at all which I try to do but its so fucking lonely.The thing is. I feel like I'm not the only one carrying my depression. I'm sure it affects my parents and one of my friends. I mean I've been told that I vent too much yet I still catch myself doing it way too much or just asking if there's space for it too much and it sucks. It might feel a bit better for a min but I'll start feeling guilty right after. And then the anxiety because I vented kicks in.I just want to be happy again or at least be able to make my surroundings happier again. I don't really remember the last time I felt like I wasn't a burden to those around me. When I'm home I can just feel that my presence is causing sadness to my mom and worry to my dad. I know I'm more of a distant friend to my little brother rather than the brother I should be. I remember hearing hanging out with me was nice. Or even being asked to hang out was probably more than half a year ago. I don't think I'd ever have to leave the house apart from doing the necessary trips to the store or whatever if it werent for me annoying people by asking them to hang out.And even if I'd succeed in having those around me be happy or at least stop feeling anxious about it I don't think the loneliness will end. There is not much social interaction at work. And even if I talk I'll start saying stupid shit again and just make a fool out of myself. After work I'm too stressed out about work or my social life, or lack thereof. In the weekends I want to recharge from the previous week and kinda prepare for the week ahead. I mean I have loads of free time then but there's not much to fill it in with. I just wake up, try to keep myself busy untill I'm able to lay in bed again and repeat untill its Monday.But what's the point of all of this? I'm not enjoying it. I'm not happy. I'm not making other people happy and probably am making people sad. I'm not going to be someone special, anyone's favorite. I'm not going to achieve anything remarkable. I'm probably going to stay that weird guy who doesn't really matter. I'm probably already being slowly phased out by most of my friends and I know that logically speaking, my death wouldn't matter to anyone apart from a handful of people around me. That's probably â?0.00003% of my country's population. Even if it were a 100 people it wouldn't matter. Life will just as easily go on and no one will ever care.I wish there was a way to end this. I've thought about jumping from a bridge yet didn't do it. Bought me some sleeping pills but after a few nights of using them and contemplating taking a load of them I flushed them. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to wait untill I die. I don't want to waste the next 60 years being alive. I just want to rest. I want to die. I want to tell my friends and family that I'm sorry and that I love them and just be done with it. But the image in my head is preventing me from doing so and it sucks.",1

1667,"Am I Depressed? : I know other posts already exist with this query, yet, even still I doubt myself.To put context, I am 17, and I've found myself increasingly less motivated in most of what I do, and almost completely incapable to pick myself up to take a pencil to paper for the homework of my classes. It's building up even now while I despair, yet no matter what I'm drawn to simply sitting around, to waiting. I don't know when specifically this began. Last year? The year before? I could technically even say the signs of noticeable lack of motivation, harsh self-critique and occasional days of inexplicable fatigue began somewhere around the end of middle school, and I'd almost say it was the cause of my first C grade- which for me was an absolute failure and evidence that I'm just lazy as it came from a lack of doing homework- in English, yet trying to say that makes me feel like it's an unforgivable attempt of brushing the failure off with an excuse.Although I have once admitted a desire for self-harm and only glanced upon the chances of depression with her, we had assumed it to be from the use of Acutane, which is of course known to cause a variety of psychological issues. However, now it's been over half a year since I quit the heavy acne medicine, and I'm still carrying these potential symptoms. If anything, to a severely worse scale.I do, though, still have my positive days. In fact, I have quite a few. To add further, I have an intense interest in writing that hasn't been dulled by any of this. In fact, it's only grown. If there is any class that I haven't been falling behind in yet, it would be my current American Literature class, simply for my love of reading and writing. I guess if anything, I've been using this as an excuse of âsee? You're happy. You're fine. You're just making an excuse for procrastinating.â?...Thing is, by now I'd have usually brought myself back up. I've always noticed a trend with myself in dipping in performance in school, only to recover and pass with As and Bs, long before I even hit an F. Right now, though, I've failed two classes lately and am probably due to fail another two if this continues...I really only ask this to confirm whether or not I should discuss with my parents on seeking treatment. It just feels like such a drastic and wasteful thing to commit if it turns out I'm somehow using this as an excuse.",1

I am a mess.Throughout my life I had no concept about my purpose, my role here. It is as if everybody else has some impulse, some force driving them and they have it all figured out, but that force never reached me. Since I was little I always felt like I am missing something, a cause, a reason, a blueprint to whatever life is supposed to be. I don't particularly believe in destiny, but it scares me sometimes. My mother barely survived while being pregnant with me, she was extremely close to being killed, for several months, it is a story that is book worthy. I was also an accident, an unplanned child. What if my life is a mistake, a divine clerical error? It would perfectly explain my feelings of being lost, of no purpose. It is a weird thought, not something I'd honestly believe, but I have no better explanation. Why have I always felt this way? NOTHING makes sense to me. When I find some sense and I start to think I am recovering, in some time I come down crashing hard again. My depression and anxiety are a definite constant in my life.I can't imagine myself waking up each day, getting ready, drinking coffee, working some job that is likely unfulfilling because I messed up my education, going home tired, thinking about what food to buy so I don't always eat the same boring things, waiting to get old... And just doing these same things every day, forever until I die. I haven't even started living properly yet and I am already tired. I see no sun on the horizon, I doubt I will find somebody who I will love and who will love me back, it seems like such a lottery, unattainable, because I could never just settle for some random person with whom I have anything less than a good emotional connection and understanding. I don't think I will ever find it, it feels like my depression, anxiety, and my lack of knowing how to deal with those in my formative years made me miss that particular train. I feel like I will simply die at some point, no sadness, no ceremony, just poof. I will never reach any peak I imagined for myself, because judging by my current trajectory, it is just a continuing trend of self disappointment. I am sad because I (like to think that I) have so much more to offer to this world than what I delivered, that opportunity and luck will all avoid me, that I will never reach my potentials in nearly anything.  Have I messed up my own chances of being happy just by being born with my ""stats""?

I'm not the loud type but I have anger deep in my heart. Yet I stay calm in hopes to find my own peace. I keep fighting with the people I live with... I just want to feel love and peace. Why does hatred and anger follow me. I want to go home and see my moms smile. I want to see the night sky without these city lights.I want see the mountains and not see a building every block.. Im falling into depression.I havent eaten all day.I sleep all morning.I want happiness.I miss home.,1
1693,"Nothing is exciting anymore, friends, hobbies all gone... : I'm sure y'all feel the same. What used to put a smile on your face no longer does. Everyday seems to fade into the next. No sleep. No friends. Motivation to do the smallest tasks is gone. Geez, hard to imagine a life better than this when it's been the same bs for years. Odd to see others having the time of their life in a college town while you struggle to even make a friend.  Anyone else in the same boat?",1

I started overhearing a conversation between them and I heard my name.Now, i've told a lot to my best friend, not most, but still a lot. She knows i feel horrible everyday, but she doesn't know how much. So one day we were talking through the phone and it was confession time and... I said the most stupid thing i could've ever have said, i said to her that she is reason why i'm still alive. I don't know i was feeling overwhelmed and I just said it. And it's true. She's my heartbeat.But she said to her friend that what i said put so much pressure on her and that it makes her sad, and I know she is feeling bad too. She feels like everything that i say or do is full of meaning, she feels like i'm not spontaneus anymore. She knows that the only way i have to get relief is getting high. She said that if i kill myself, something will broke, and that she won't be able to live anymore.WHAT THE FUCK HAVE I DONE I HATE MYSELFWhy did i said that, that's the stupidiest thing i could've ever have said and now i know how she feels about it. I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking selfish.I can't say shit anymore, to anyone. Now i know how much it affects my loved ones. And how it destroys m'y relationship with them. I can never open myself like that anymore, because i'm gonna destroy everyone i love if i do. I'm alone now. And now the only thing keeping myself at the verge of life is knowing that if i kill myself, i kill her. This and the fact that, if i keep living, i'm poisining her.I'm toxic, and i'm alone.",1

And now she's showing signs of depression: not eating, always tired, etc. What I'm asking is for advice on what I can do/say to help her through this tough time.",1
1701,"I just feel guilty for feeling the way I do : I always think about how I want to die, kill myself more specifically, only to then think about how much it would hurt my friends and family to know I did that. But that doesn't actually make me not want to kill myself, it just makes me feel guilty for thinking that way, which just makes me feel worse and worse about myself. I've been trying for years to be better but nothing seems to actually change and I feel like when I try to talk about it to my friends and loved ones they just don't really get it. My parents just stress out and make me feel even worse for feeling the way I do. Not intentionally, but they don't really get it it feels like and I feel like I burden them with it. I have no reason to feel this way and that just makes it worse, there's people who have it way worse in life than I do, I have no reason to hate living but I do, the idea of it just brings me dread, and all of that just funnels back in on me feeling worse and worse about being depressed. When I try medication it feels like nothing actually changes, like the thoughts and feelings remain the same. This all just creates an endless cycle of self loathing that I feel like I can't escape from and it's getting to be more than I can take anymore.

1702,"""Other people have it worse than you"" and similar kinds of *advice* : Why do people throw this out there as if it will ever make someone feel better? Almost every time someone reaches out and offers to listen, this sentence gets said at some point. How is it supposed to help? Am I supposed to take comfort in the fact that other people are suffering too? Am I supposed to be happy that other people feel even worse than I do somehow? What's the goal when people say this??I just don't understand. If anything it just makes me feel worse and hate myself even more, because I end up turning that thought into how my problems are insignificant and unimportant, and that I should feel guilty for even being sad in the first place. Which turns into a spiral of me feeling even more down, and getting massive anxiety that the person who told me it now looks at me as a loser, who's only complaining about inconsequential selfish shit, instead of someone who's legitimately hurting.Why? Why are things like this such a common thing to throw in someone's face to try and ""help"" them? Why do so many people think that this will ever make anyone feel any better at all??? It's made me so tired of even trying to tell anyone about my depression out of fear that I'll be belittled and told my problems don't matter.",1

1704,"It's starting all over again : (First post) Lately, I've felt different. I can't find a reason to do anything. A while back, I was doing okay with my mental health. I had just starting feeling better. Then everything went downhill. I've been staring at knives, razors, scissors, anything- and I've been fantasizing the way I could sh myself. It's getting bad, and I feel like I can't go to anyone. I'm seeing a counselor, but I'm way to paranoid to open up to them completely. I really want to get help, because I want to be normal. I don't want to be sad anymore. I wanna go back to when I was doing okay. I don't want these sudden outbursts of joy, only to feel worthless afterwards. I want to be able to feel loved again, and be loved by someone. I'm so tired of being lonely, crying myself to sleep, and scratching at my arms and legs. The only good moments in my life are when I can't feel anything at all. Really, I wish I could've never felt anything at all. And honestly, I don't want anyone to feel the way I do, because it really hurts. But then again, there are times I so desperately want everyone to feel the hell I go through. It sounds so selfish, I know. But deep down, I'd never wish that even the worst person in the world would have to endure the miserable hell i have started putting myself through. I feel like I deserve to feel this way..ya know?",1
1705,I've been thinking about ending it all. : I have one of my knives in my bathroom just so that I could do it whenever I want to. I'm not worth anyone's time or money. I'm failing all my classes and getting sent away to a shitty private school because of it. All of my 2 friends are gonna get left behind because I'll be staying on campus. I don't know if it's worth it to keep going. I've been starving myself and cutting for months and I just want it to end. How am I supposed to keep going when I feel like a pathetic waste of time and energy to everyone around me? I haven't ever gone and told my friends or family about this shit but still I think they know. My mom goes through all my drawings/notebooks everyday just to make sure I'm not writing another suicide note. How do I turn this around?,1
1706,"It's like whiplash. This desperate, primal craving to get better, is then consumed by a sudden terror I cannot shake. The scariest part is, I don't know if I want to get better : I've always hated that saying, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". I don't feel stronger for the things I've experienced. At one point I did, when it was just the depression, both mine and my father's, but then there came the ""family friend"" that sexually assaulted me. Then came the toxic best friend. Then came the boyfriend that I clung to in an unhealthy, Co-dependant relationship. Then came reporting the sexual assault, to have the police not belive me, I'd left it too late. Then there was the breakup, then the drugs, then the move back in with my parents. And now I'm alone, unemployed, and feel like I'll never leave my bed. It's been months. What scares me the most is, I don't know if I even want to get better at this point.",1
1707,"Checking-in : This has been a tough year on me and Ik that experiences like the ones I am going through will eventually make me stronger. It's unrealistic for me to believe that things will become easier as time moves on because what I have heard is quite the contrary. It's the end of February and I'm still recovering from the deep wounds of my most recent break up. As well as the stress that's been piling up on me due to an increase in my responsibilities. Whether it be for self, work, or family. I feel like Peter Parker that no matter what I do I am going to fail. It's a terrifying thought that things are never going to get better and feeling like I'm never going to improve. My introverted tendencies and desire for immediate satisfaction are going to be my downfall. I only hope that I can get it together to avoid such a fate.",1

1711,"Loneliness : I went grocery shopping after work today. I usually don't go to stores because they overwhelm me. Tonight, I decided to go while wearing earbuds and listening to some calming music. I made it almost through the entire trip before I felt an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. Like being in a crowded room, and feeling invisible loneliness. That kind. I started crying. I didn't care. There I was, picking out fresh food to nourish my soul and body. Something I rarely do. Went through self-check out. Still crying. Nobody said anything. I think I preferred it that way. Made it out to the car, and cried all the way home. Now I'm crying in bed, with one of my dear cats cradled on my chest (her choice solely). It's a rarity that my pets will snuggle with me. It's been a very long, very lonely, and turbulent time recently. I'm recovering from a miscarriage, my husband is working overseas, and I'm facing all of myself alone. I have a significant trauma history, and am reactivated almost daily by most people and many situations.As in writing this, I'm feeling like a shadow on the wall. I'm not ready to give up, but goddamnit I'm tired. To all the lonely people out there tonight, I see you.",1

1714,"Descriptions : I tried my best to describe how I feel when trying to fall asleep some nights, putting it in words and posting it somewhere really helps, even if nobody really gives a damn in the end You turn off the light in your bedroom, and place your phone on the charger. The math has been done, if you immediately go to sleep now you'll get exactly 6 hours of rest before you have to wake up. Upon hitting the pillow, you just lay there.It only takes a few seconds, before you partake in the most dangerous game, actually thinking. All of a sudden, you feel a wave of sadness rush over you, seemingly originating from your stomach. Feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and pure sadness.""Why am I sad?"", You ask yourself. You lie there thinking, but you really can't find a good reason. Before long, you are thinking about your entire life. ""What am I doing wrong?"", ""Why do I struggle so much to socialize?"", ""Do I hold any real value to this world?"", These questions are racing through your mind.If you dropped dead, would anyone mourn? Probably, but would they really? No, but yes they would? All you can do is go back and forth, thinking of ideas and immediately doubting yourself and your own validity.Don't even bother asking why you are like this, and then a wave of anxiety rushes over you as you remember you were trying to sleep. How long has it been? You think about reaching for your phone, but you don't.Even though the phone is right there, to pick it up feels like it requires a mountainous amount of willpower and strength. After 5 minutes of thinking about picking up the phone, you finally do. 3 in the morning, nice going dumbass. Do you really fuck everything up like this? You know you're worthless, and now you're going to be tired all day tomorrow. I applaud you, actual braindead moron.As you realize you were thinking those thoughts, small amounts of anxiety and pain flutter through your stomach. You must have something deeply wrong with you, but things are slowing down and not making much sense. At least you're finally falling asleep",1

Cant use university therapist dont go to the uni anymore cant reach out to betterhelp theyll just take me to a crisis like and tell me to call another number that tells me to call another number that tells me they dont take my insurance bcits through an employer.

Im DESPERATE. This âgetting helpâ?bullcrap is the last resort and all people do is press it if you arent okay so if the services are for people who arent ok then wtf is with these services.

It make me feel like it's my fault for feeling this way like I'm not strong enough to resist the urge. It's not that simple. It's not just sadness. It's horrible and I just want it to stop. But she doesn't get it. She thinks she has depression too, and possibly she has a milder form.But why would she say that to me? I told her I cut and I get condescending messages back saying I'm stupid for doing that. I can't trust her. She hasn't replied after those messages. I think she hates me.I'm sorry I know my depression isn't bad and you guys have it worse and I know I'm just overreacting and being a useless sensitive b*tch. But I feel like I can't trust her and she hurt me a lot and It's not that simple. I can't just snap out of it.Its my fault I cut. It's my fault I chose to feel this depression I chose depression. This is what she's implying. And it's like she doesn't want to hear me talking about cutting and suicide. And I get it. No one is equipped to deal with a friend saying this. I understand it brings shock and confusion. But that doesn't make it less hurtful.I guess I'm just not a good friend. I'll try not to bring it up again.",1

I love my son so much and I worry that I'm not doing enough for him.",1
1739,"How do you know if you're healed from situational depression? : Three years ago today I was in a car accident that killed my friend. It turned my life upside down, and finally after a year and a half, I went on anti depressants and went to therapy. These past 3 years have been the darkest of my life, but since switching meds this past September I finally got the motivation to start bettering my life. I've started to really make plans for myself and I'm excited, but I still have moments of doubt. So I'm wondering, when do you know it's time to come off meds? I really want to go back to feeling what it's like to live as my real self. And have deeper emotions. I'm just worried that I'd be taking the bandage off before it's fully healed. Like what if I'm not as motivated as I thought I was, and I fail? And I spiral down and have to come back on meds? Or maybe I'm just lazy?",1
1740,"how do i not think about suicide? : for the past few years suicide has been heavy on my mind. i've been able to control it and i constantly tell my self it'll be ok and suicide shouldn't be an option, ive always been strong like that. but lately the feelings have gotten stronger and i'm finding it really hard not to just say f it. i have lots of family problems, not maybe supports and i've been kinda falling down a dark road cause i have shit all to do. i don't have a job, don't go to school, haven't been able to register my car so can't go out and see friends unless they pick me up. it just seems like life doesn't have a plan for me and i don't know how to start planning something out. i don't have any motivation for anything. often find myself convincing myself to just end it but i know that i shouldn't. i find myself thinking of ways to do it when i'm just sitting in a room. the tools i would use and the out comes. i don't want this dark thinking cause i'm scared i might just do it, was anyone here at this point? if you have would you mind filling me in a bit? i'm a 17 year old girl and my life's just starting, i don't want to end it despite my life.",1

1742,"I can't escape it. : No matter how hard I try, it always seems to be there. I can have a good time in classes but the moment I step out and come back, everything just ""switches off."" It's hard to really see what the point is in doing any of this, to continue on knowing that things won't get better; I almost don't want it to get better at all. I have suicidal ideations every day, and I need to put on this fake smile every time I run into someone I know. I don't think anyone really knows who I am--I don't even know who I am anymore. I can't recall a time where I was normatively happy on a daily basis. I drank until I blacked out two nights in a row on Friday and Saturday night. I need to take a couple pills of Benadryl to even go to sleep. I think my time will come to an end soon; there's no other way out of this hole. There's a strange comfort in knowing that I can end it all so soon, and never feel this way, or any way, ever again. Maybe I'll disappoint my family and friends, but  I've already disappointed myself on so many occasions, it doesn't matter any more. I can barely look at myself in the mirror, I hang my head when I walk to an from classes, I'm invisible to everyone and myself. Life is just one giant distraction from the inevitable of which is our end--our death. I'm peering over the cliff's edge, and all I see is darkness, an abyss. The light at the end of the tunnel has long since gone out. I can't even cry anymore at this point. Worthless.",1

It doesn't matter who was, all they see me now is some hopeless lazy piece of shit they just want to go away. All the friends I thought had now Ignore me. If not sleeping to escape then I'm eating to fill this void, just to vomit it up afterwards. I'm so detached from myself and reality, I already feel like I'm dead.",1

I'm not being treated like I'm a drug seeking addict. The offices are beautiful.My Drsâ?attitudes are basically like âOkay we got this. We see it all the time. Don't worry.â?I'm happy. For the first time in years, I'm legitimately happy. Sure it's $250 or so a week right now but I can actually afford it and realistically it's saving me tons of money vs going to the bar or doing drugs.The health care system is fucked up but I'm happy I'm finally getting the help I need.",1

1747,"I feel broken : I feel like I'm broken. I don't know how to act like a functioning person. I barely manage to take care of myself. Some days I go without eating and on others I just eat garbage and make myself feel even worse. I can't take care of myself. My general hygiene is terrible because I barely leave my room. I haven't taken a bath or shower in weeks because I just can't bring myself to do it. I haven't brushed my teeth consistently in years and they're a constant reminder of how broken i am. My room is a constant mess because i can't bring myself to do anything about it and the fact that I know I should do all of these things just makes me feel even worse. I feel like a disgusting shell who can't function like a normal person. I either spend all my time sleeping or just passing time doing nothing in my room until its time to sleep again. Everything feels like its behind glass most of the time and I've lost interest in everything I used to like. I feel so disgusting and broken compared to everyone I know.

I don't know how to talk about this with my parents. I'm really struggling to convey my thoughts and feelings to them. I'm really frustrated and worried, but all the can say is the usual âtry your bestâ?and âstick through itâ? I know they mean well. I struggle with the whole mental health thing, and I feel like if I say I'm struggling it makes less of the situations of people who are really struggling with mental health. I've talked to my mum a bit but it almost feels like she has a stigma against therapy. Like you need to be really unwell to actually get up and drive to a therapist, and she doesn't think I'm unwell. I guess she can only see the outside of me and doesn't realize I'm struggling in the inside, even though I'm pretty sure it should be quite obvious. I had a big break up a few years ago which has still been affecting me. I suppose my mum thinks that when I cry about it it's part of the grieving process, but I feel like it's just the straw that breaks the camels back on the feelings within me, and it all becomes too much.Any advice would be much appreciated",1

One of the few things that I  prioritize in my life is schoolwork. I study, I do homework, I prepare, I take notes etc... granted, my preparation was flawed. But beyond that?My body is slowly falling apart.Skin is dry as hell, I eat erratically, I barely exercise, my overbite is returning after getting off braces treatment, I shower once a week, I rarely comb my hair, I'm reluctant to do anything else but play Xbox and browse memes on weekends, etc.Then... as I think about this, and what I actually am... I just say; ""What the hell?""It makes me feel ashamed of myself, if I were to be honest; I feel ashamed because I know that I'm essentially fucking myself up and ruining my own life. Yet, I cant really stop it... my brain must wants to me to lay there...I dont know guys... but this reawakened body image issue is really messing with me.",1
1752,Why is everything so repetitive. : I feel like I'm stuck in a loop of the same shit every. Single. Day. I feel like the only way out is suicide but that comes with its own negatives. Lately everything has just been becoming more and more boring to a point of i don't even play my computer any more. I just come home from doing nothing at school and laying in my bed for seven hours until i go to sleep and start over. I just stoped caring. Stoped caring about being tired all the time. Stoped caring about being bored all the time. Stoped caring about not wanting to do anything. Stoped caring about having nothing to do. I want to see a therapist but i just don't have the energy to. I want to stop laying in my bed all the time i just don't have the energy to. I want to get my life together i just don't have the energy to. What do i do i feel so stuck with nothing to do.

1753,"Pity party: I'm a toxic person. : I truly can't sleep tonight. I keep thinking about my toxic behaviors and I'm feeling really unmotivated/sad. Like I don't want to ever socialize ever again. I definitely say and do passive aggressive things that can be played off as a joke, then I immediately feel guilt and shame for it. Like, I'll do or say something that I was angry or feeling petty about, then I'll immediately feel upset and shameful for even doing it. It'll mostly be very impulsive and then I'll feel really angry right after, like ""Yeah that person I said that too is horrible! You showed them!!!"" then in about a minute, I'll be like ""Wow, I'm really horrible. That had really angry undertones to it and idk if they knew it, but let me apologize anyways. I feel really bad, I'm horrible"".Idk, I'm just trying to post on subreddits for comfort mostly. Idk if I'm lonely, because when it's time to socialize, I feel so unmotivated and would rather be in bed. I don't know anyone to talk to about this because my boyfriend won't understand. I feel so ashamed of my behavior but I can't control it and idk how to. My therapist (courtesy of college) just tells me to ""pay attention to your feelings, control your reaction"" but it's not that simple for me. It all happens in a millisecond and I don't feel like I have control. Idk. I'm toxic and terrible tbh. Sorry for unloading this on this subreddit.",1
1754,"College is making my depression close to unbearable : I've been in college for almost 3 years now (going for computer science) and  last semester and the current one I'm in have been gradually taking their tolls on me. I've had to fight with my depression since I've started college but these past two semesters have been particularly  awful. I transferred to a university this semester after being at a community college for 2.5 years and I feel like that may have to do with it somewhat? I also think I'm just very scared and depressed of the future, as I am halfway done and am looking into internships and such. My current semester I'm struggling in all of my classes and it's hard keep up. I dont have the motivation to try and learn what all my professors arent teaching me and I'm terrified to ask for help because I'm afraid of being looked at as a dumbass, which is a really hard thing for me. Aside from that, I find it increasingly hard to be around people and when I'm alone, all I can think about is how I want to  just leave; leave college, leave everything, leave this world. But I want to accomplish getting a degree because that would be big for me. The past probably two weeks it has gotten really severe. It's hard for me to enjoy or do anything and sometimes all I can do is lay in bed and try to convince myself not to end it. Balancing college and depression is turning into a losing battle for me at this point and I'm unsure what to do.. I'm constantly going back and forth between trying to keep myself motivated and just feeling like a failure but it seems I'm feeling like a failure more than anything lately. I just cant help but wonder if I'll make it through college and if I can even get anything after college because of this. I just feel very alone and  kinda hopeless at this point :/I hope this doesnt sound dumb but I needed to say this.",1

Losing my dog was the cherry on top of an already fucked up year especially the past few months. I don't know how much longer I can take anymore. Survival instinct is blinding me from reality. I don't want to believe that this is it this is all that life is. Life is death and I'm tired of being a witness to such a depressing reality. I'm tired of living a life I know will never get better. I don't want to get better or even know what would even make it tolerable anymore. I want to pretend this life was a bad dream. I want to sleep and never wake up. Please something anything give me the strength to lull myself. Please God, universe or whatever that's out there please end my existence. I don't know why people like me even exist.

Like, not in a sense that I want to kill myself, but just, like, I'm genuinely not supposed to be alive. Like I wasn't meant to exist, but I am anyway. I'm a religious person kinda, as I was raised Catholic, and so I believe every one has a plan or reason for being on this planet, but I honestly don't think there is a reason for me. I'm just here. For no point at all but to take up space. The thing is, I'm not even sad. I'm not suicidal or even that depressed, but idk. I want to be sad or angry or something but I just don't feel anything. I don't cry at things that are sad, I don't react to things like everyone else. For example, a sorta traumatic thing happened at work the other day to a coworker of mine, and while I understand why everyone was crying and shaken up about it, I didn't feel anything. I was respectful and whatnot, but I didn't feel anything. And I never have felt anything to any sort of traumatic thing in my life. I feel like I can't experience love or any form of attraction either. I don't feel connected with my friends or family, and it should scare me but it doesn't. I want it to, but it doesn't.

1757,"I'm right back where I started : In August 2019 my (ex)girlfriend left me. At the time I was extremely overweight, a borderline alcoholic and hadn't had a job in about a year (although I still went to uni). I spent a hellish and lonely year working on myself, using the pain to drop 27kg, graduate uni, get a part-time job and focus on my mental health. I suppose to an extent it paid off since I met my current gf on Tinder and on paper it seemed like I had gotten my life together. But old habits began creeping back in. Long story short, I put on all the weight plus some, I drink multiple times a week alone in my bedroom and all I do is work 2 short 4-5 hour morning shifts a week and that's it. Today my mum and her partner found my hidden stash of empty alcohol cans/bottles and are obviously extremely disappointed and worried. I find it hard to do anything, I just feel so numb and I feel like I have zero motivation or energy to do anything. I feel like I'm at a point where if I don't change soon, I'll be still living at home at 25 with no real job despite getting a degree and just spiral ling further into loneliness and depression.

I love you all so muchly"" and I just feel like such shit because my fist impulse was to let her know that she was wrong. My day was in fact very shitty and it's so frustrating that I'd rather say that then accept the sentiment and be cheered by her words. She also struggles with depression so it just feels like my impulse to respond with negativity is this weird desire to pull her down to my level.

1763,"I'm trying really hard to get out of everyone's way, maybe underground I can get some fucking quiet. : This story is about a boy that never left Neverland.I fucking HATE Las Vegas.Don't move here out of boredom, don't move here if you are prone to bouts of manic highs and lows. Don't move here if you respect humanity. Don't move here to escape reality.I did. Why? I'm a fool. I'm a fool who never learned to be a man. I saw Showgirls once (or eight) when I was fourteen recording it on vhs from my dad's bootleg cable tv setup (yeah I'm 37, in self-loathing years I feel only a day shy of dead tired) and besides trying to watch it on mute with a boner that could cut diamonds I thought âhey wouldn't it be cool to be the guy at the bar/club everyone knows and all the women think is a mysterious bad boy?â?This foolish way of thinking persisted as I focused on what I didn't âhaveâ?in life. I thought it was empty, yet exciting, chapters of sexual conquest. Rebellion at the rigidity of following trends, living for wild nights and eating party drugs at dives and snorting coke off hookers and strippers. What I really was seeking was Validation: Someone in high school to acknowledge I was âacceptedâ? girls to look at me like, well to look at me at all. That Validation is bittersweet, you are never fully satisfied when you get it because you don't feel worthy of being happy. You aren't given self-worth you fight for it. Yeah, I started late but I did that. The rockstar shit with no musical talent. I lived in Atlanta most of my life until about two years ago in a single bedroom with no roommates for about three years. All I did was work enough odd jobs to pay rent and buy about a gram of blow every few weeks, some weed and two weeks worth of groceries. I lived for the weekend of going to my favorite bars and seeing the regulars and using âgameâ?to see who I could pull that night.Yeah that âgameâ? I was one of those lame guys looking up PUA techniques back when the pick up artist Mystery was a thing on VH1. In fact I got to deep in the dreaded toxic red-pill way of thinking for a while. That phase is long gone now. Men and women are fucking devious to each other until proven otherwise. I've embraced this.Also while I'm at it, FUCK ROOSH V. Moving on.A life of the bad boy lifestyle, for lack of a better term, turned on me three years ago. Ironically during sex with a beautiful but fragile Indonesian college chick I met at my best dive in the city. At one point in the middle of it we went from madly entwined, filthy, primal. Then I ð¥ and we are laying parallel in my bed naked on a balmy Sunday night. That moment right after cumming and all the dirty talk where your naked skin can't hide your feelings she tried to have a real conversation with me:âWhy? This is a hookup. We agreed before she got hereâ?I switch on the charm and get her mind thinking about my dick rather than my personality, but I knew something had changed in me. Looking back now it was the beginning of me wanting more, someone in my corner. Not a lover, a trophy of how masculine I was, not a crazy sexy story, I wanted a partner in crime. A best friend that liked my genitals, someone who wanted to âunderstand meâ?I don't have to go into details you already know. I hurt her, she really tried to get to know me and hang again but I blew her off. She was one of a few. I still carry that weight.So being bored and restless in Atl I somehow convinced myself that Las Vegas Nevada was the place for a wild boy like me. In reality I should of stepped away from the partying and figured out why I had this restlessness and why the old shit was leaving me more hollow.So I moved. To make a long story a little shorter, Karma has caught up to me. I've been here two years. Since I ârebelledâ?against proper advice and building any type of fallback skill or career I have no real career skill, just retail history and some warehouse years. I've only managed to gain part-time gigs and temp work.My mom actually moved here to help and brought my pup too. My 8 year old German Shepard who I'm currently ignoring cause she doesn't need to be around me in this shape. I've never physically abused her, but my antisocial mood sweeps are affecting her and my poor mother who is actually taken to Las Vegas much better than I. I'm dragging them both down with my moody bipolar bullshit and it's getting worse and worse between us all.Sex life is purposely in timeout. In two years I've met women as shady and distressed as me. Junkies chicks that offered me Meth just for letting them bum a cigarette, local Nevadan women so destroyed by dealing with gambling addicts and dudes who love the alcohol more than human decency, a few prostitutes (yeah I know, fucking kill me alright), broke strippers with gold hearts, and aborted attempts at having an affair with a woman that was engaged.I feel like I definitely deserve this. I'm amazed I don't have kids and a few stds. I'm a freak but a cautious one. Last year after Thanksgiving I went in my bathroom with a butcher knife. My dog barking at the front door at whoever. I'm in their with my phone, the knife at my wrist and about a half oz of weed (just in case I decide to not kill myself). The ONLY reason I didn't do it was because I decided to call a suicide hotline for the first time ever. I cried like two newborn babies when the woman on the other end, with the gentleness of a maternal god said to me:âThe fact that you called, shows that you don't want to end it all. You just want someone to understand youâ?Such a simple observation it seems insulting. Like âyeah no shitâ? She might as well told me the Secret to Eternal life, that's how hard her words hit. I hung up the phone and smoked the weed.Now here we are, 2020. I skipped some details, but I'm so goddamn weathered and beat up internally and externally. I can't let go of âthe weightâ?and guilt of my lust for life. I lived my life based on being the âbad boyâ?and look at me. No career, nicotine addiction, no family of my own, no partner in crime that likes my genitals to build a life with. I'm 37 and I've fucked up my whole life. $5 in my bank account, I'm avoiding calling friends now too. 10 lbs lighter and I'm just lying in bed like fuck it.Why is this fuck up still here contributing nothing? Should of finished the job at 14 instead of watching that stupid movie thinking being a bar crawling scumbag would be a life worth living. Should of did it last year, I really really want to be out of everyone's way including my own.If you read this you are a saint or extremely bored and patient.

I am the sadness in your eyes, the story you won't tell. I am the way you see the pain in others. I am cause and effect. I am your heavy heart, your apathy. You can't let me go, you don't know how. I engulf you, in every way, like quicksand there is no way out. I will leave you in the dark, alone, isolated, terrified, screaming, and In pain, forgotten. I will wound you in was you cannot describe. I will harm you in ways no one can see. I am trauma, I am abuse, I am the aftermath, i am the depths of your mind, I am everything you fear, I am suicide, I am the death you long for. I am pain, anguish, confusion and hatred. I am the reason you don't function. I am the short fuse. I feel like a heart attack, crushing you with the weight of my invisible fury. I am elusive, intrinsic, unbearable, inescapable.I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS .",1
1766,"It sucks that good people such as myself have to die, but I suppose some of us just meant to live in the world the way it is. : Maybe I'm alone in thinking this, but i just feel like i want to scream and cry for someone to help, someone to pull me up as i drown, yet i know no one can because they simply cannot help me. The world, the way it is now, it's just too painful for me to live in as who i am. Sure, i have a great life from everyone else's perspective, so i guess i'm just an ungrateful shit anyway. All i do is play vidya all day and i don't even pay rent in my 4,200 sq ft house. So naturally, i don't think i really have a reason i should be unhappy. Yet from my core i am in pain, constant, and never ending. I am haunted by the darkness at the edge of my vision and recently it only gets worse. I scream in my sleep from nightmares frequently, I've literally punched myself in the face in my sleep too. I want to claw my skin off sometimes and others i want to cry myself into a coma. Sometimes i just need to feel pain or impact, like how 20 mins ago i beat myself with a wood sword. Now here i am bitching on Reddit in a post no one is even going to fucking read.   What i want, is romance, i want to fall in love. without that i don't want to live. I'll be 25 in a few months, still haven't had my first kiss and i'm not gonna mince words, i'm a failure. It's already too late to save whatever's left. I know that the wholesome lovey-dovey romance i want isn't possible in this world. After i realized that a few months ago i began a downward spiral from which i will never escape. I still need to finish some things while I'm still alive, things that transcend my meaningless feelings. I really don't want to leave if i'm being honest. I've built with my own two hands a non-blood related family which i know loves me and will always support me. I don't want to crush them with the weight of my death, but what am i to do? I'm not invincible, a man can only take so much torment. Should i have to endure this for them forever? I'll try as long as i can but one day the last of my willpower will erode away.",1
1767,"Any advice. Any. : Fuck making a throwaway, I'll just write my thoughts and see what happens.20M, mandatory community service. I'm doing it at a library, I believe it was the only place left in my hometown right now to do it. So in a lot of ways I could say I'm lucky. Didn't have to move anywhere, didn't have to even change my gym membership or anything.But the library is destroying my fucking head. It's me either doing overly easy tasks that have gotten pretty goddamn boring after 2 months of being there, or it's me having nothing to do because it often feels like they don't really even need me. But I still can't fill this time with something else like being on my phone or reading books or whatever because the staff still wants me to do something... even if there's nothing to do. You know the kind of people that just make no goddamn sense. Like how dare you just wait for more work!!! Do that thing again then even if there's no need to!!I tried talking about this immediately with family etc, but they're just ignoring it. First they gave a pretty good point saying that it takes a couple weeks to a month for something to become a routine so just keep going. But now it's been 2 months of just endless slow, boring, mind-numbingly fucking frustrating days and I'm so tired of it. And of course now when I try talking about it, it's just ignored. It's that instant ""stop complaining"" thing. I read how it's about attitude often, and doing it just to be able to enjoy other things. But this library is in my FUCKING WAY constantly. Can't relax and enjoy movies, music, shows or games because the library's in my head constantly. If the two months had gone fast, 9 more wouldn't sound so bad. But they've been SO SLOW. Sooooooo slow. 9 more sounds awful.Hitting a wall or screaming doesn't help. The only thing so far relieving some of the anger is hitting myself in the head and slapping myself hard. That's the only thing that lets some pressure and frustration out. Hitting objects doesn't help because it's me trying to find an alternative to real pain and violence, and those things are in my mind A LOT at the moment.Over a year ago a childhood friend of mine killed himself because of bad depression and ignorant people around him just ignoring his dreams and not being supportive in any way or helping with his mental health. He was always a super ambitious and smart person. I'm not suicidal at the moment, but the more people just fucking ignore my terrible feelings and the more I'm forced to go to this place every day, the more I'm starting to like the idea of doing something bad. I don't know what's gonna happen if I hear ""you just gotta do it"" one more time.I don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. Any sort of advice probably. Bro 9 more months of this. NINE.",1
1768,"I never thought I would, but I'm starting to become depressed... : My whole life up until my senior year in high school was so nice. No responsibilities and I honestly went through life without knowing the direction of my life.College hit me like a truck. I was a pretty good student in high school and being in an Asian household, you can expect my sadness when I got rejected from every single university that I wanted to go to. I decided on community college so I won't be a financial burden on my parents. My parents aren't that strict, but I know they were extremely disappointed in me, especially when I already changed my major twice in the past year. I settled on being a nursing major because my brother is a nurse, but I don't even know if its right for me.Lots of negative things also happened this past year. I barely have anyone to talk to at my community college and I'm not the social type. I moved churches because I didn't like the people there but my new church also doesn't really welcome me. My two close friends (one who I had a crush on) hang out a lot without me and it's beginning to feel like a fake friendship. I basically have no friends and no sense of community.I can't focus on my classes. I quit my job to focus, but I find myself constantly doubting myself. I want to do good because I want to have a family in the future, but it seems too far away and too stressful. I find myself studying for tests at the last second because I just depressingly watch shows all weekend due to a lack of drive. I don't have the best relationship with my family either. My mom is supporting, but I think she understands how futile my future is. I guess everything came so quickly and I wasn't able to handle it. This has been developing a lot recently and I'm slowly becoming depressed. I'm afraid to kill myself, but the thought of death doesn't sound too bad.If anyone can give me advice, I would appreciate it.",1

Hanging is too painful, jumping is too scary, and I got nothing to overdose on. Maybe one day I'll muster the courage to do it. Maybe I'll find a large rock and walk into the ocean with it so I drown.",1
1771,"Sat outside of an ER contemplating whether or not to go in. : I went out driving with nothing good on my mind. I didn't know where to go with my thoughts, or how to deal with them. My mind was completely blank yet at the same time it was going at 1000 miles an hour. I found myself driving to the ER, thinking maybe somehow someone there could help me at a time when there was no way I could help myself. When I got there, I was too scared to go in. I thought of all the medical bills, my insurance it probably wouldn't cover, the people I couldn't risk finding out, the fear of being locked away with nothing but a stain on my records to be shown for it, the doctors that possibly wouldn't take my very serious issues seriously. I sat in that parking spot near the entrance of the building until I finally felt numb enough to reverse out and away from that hospital.I feel weak. I feel like i've exhausted all options, and i'm worn down from all the attempts to feel somewhat close to better again. Now I lay at home in my bed, feeling just as empty as before.",1
1772,"19, Gay, Lonely and Bitter :        First post on reddit so this'll probably be a bit worse than it maybe would normally be.     First of all, I'm a 19 year old gay guy om my last semester in college before transfering to a new college. I've been single my whole life and honestly at this point the feeling of loneliness is eating me up. I can't watch gay couples be happy anymore because it makes me feel so bitter and jealous that I dont have what they have and they I'm going to lose out on the teenage gay dates that I dreamed about in high school. Recently, I managed to ask out a guy I was interested in recently (he said i wasnt his type) and I thought this would be a huge step towards progress but now I feel like there's no one left.      To be clear, I'm glad I asked him out. I feel now like I can move on and not stay stuck on him like I have with other guys. But college is so much less social than high school was for me and I feel like there isnt anyone out there for me to date. At least no one I'd be able to date in the few months I have before transfering.      My loneliness has become worse recently because I stopped talking to my best friend. We got in a fight after I told her I asked someone out and how much my loneliness has been hurting me. I felt like I had to stop talking to her because it hurt having a conversation with someone about feeling how deeply painful this loneliness I'm feeling is when they're in a 2 year long relationship and living with their boyfriend and raising a dog. How do you tell someone that the reason it hurts to be unloved by anyone is because you cant even comprehend being loved in the first place?      I dont know how to explain this loneliness, all I know is how bitter I've become. I dont even want to talk to other guys because I dont want to get my hopes up and get hurt. I honestly hate how bitter I'm becoming, and even worse is I hate how little I'm doing to stop it. Even when I spend time with friends it can be fun and fulfilling but when I'm home alone it all feels empty. I have a friend who just broke up with his girlfriend and now suddenly wants to hang out a ton, and I'm flattered but I keep getting these thoughts of ""I've been lonely like this for so long and you did nothing, why should I help you?"" It hurts me to think that and it hurts me to see how often I do it.    Before, I thought having sex would help my loneliness but then I lost my virginity to a guy on a dating app and I felt terrible about it. Several hookups with other guys later, I've realized that I probably just wanted to feel attractive. All the guys I've been with have been significantly older than me and I have started feeling like the older guys just want to exploit my youth and the guys my age are too good for me and that I'm not attractive enough for them        A year ago i used to weigh around 230 pounds (I'm 5'9 so pretty overweight, especially for a gay guy) and my mom would make comments about it. Last semester, I started adderall for my ADHD and one of the side effects is that it suppresses my appetite, so for the last year I've been using it to starve myself and skip meals so that I can lose weight and be more attractive. In the about 6 months since I started I've gotten down to 185 pounds, but even despite that, I dont feel attractive. I feel as though all I can see are the guys that reject me on Grindr and then i ignore the attraction from all the guys thatI dont find attractive. Hell, even the ones that I do find attractive dont make me feel better; I just feel like I managed to trick them into believing that I'm attractive.        I've been scraping by each day for the past month and a half and it's clear that this loneliness, now including a lack of a best friend, is affecting my life. I failed an exam for the first time ever (I'm a 4.0 gpa student with 1 B in my college career) and I feel like my life is drifting away from everything. I'm hoping that when I transfer I can become someone I more enjoy and start fresh. I wanna get a couple tattoos and a couple piercings, cut my hair and embrace a new side of me, but I'm scared that I'll just feel more alone. Honestly, I dont know if I can handle being more alone. I'm not even sure how I've survived this long, and I've noticed that I dont even let myself think of long term plans because I'm not sure if I'll make it to then.       I've seen the effects of suicide (a close friend of mine passed away from it when I was in high school) and I wouldnt want to hurt anyone like that, especially not my mom (she told me directly how much a loss like that would hurt her and my siblings) but honestly I feel like I'm failing in life. Ive had tons more suicidal thoughts than I usually have, and i catch myself feeling like I wanna give up while I'm behind      I'm still trying to push on. I'm hoping that something will change for the better and that maybe it'll he one huge thing tommorow, or next week, or maybe it'll be a bunch of little things. Either way its something better, and  I'm doing my best to hold out to see those things come true. I'm just scared at how hard it's been getting to keep moving forward and I'm not sure how I'm going to keep managing. If I fail my classes I wont transfer and I already have plans to move in June.       Im sorry for the long post, I needed to get that out of my system. I'll appreciate any insight or comments, but just being able to say this , even to anonymous strangers that might never see this, is helping.",1

As I write this at 4:30am with tears rolling down my face I realize I have to make a change or I won't make it at all. My depression started at about 19. For the last 2 years my days have consisted of me laying in bed and watching Netflix all day. You might think this is an exaggeration but sadly it is not, I do nothing. I have nobody. I haven't had a friend in years also not exaggerating. I have pretty much zero communication with the outside world. Except when I go to the grocery store or gas station that's about it. I'm 22 years old and I have already wasted 2 years of my life. I am a waste. I am nothing. I don't think I can put in to words how much I truly fucking hate myself. People always say to reach out to friends for help but I HAVE NOBODY. So what the fuck are you supposed to do when you have nobody to help pick up the pieces. I've been trying to make myself go on walks or to the gym or even walk around my house. I reached 4000 steps the other day and was proud of myself. Usually only get less than 1000. I'm conventionally attractive and will sometimes have a fling to make myself feel somewhat better. But I'm a mess. I'd rather be alone. I've gotten so used to this nothingness going out and doing things spark no interest in me. I'm worried I'll end up getting a blood clot in my leg and die or something from not moving and then nobody will find my body and I will rot for weeks while my cats eat me or some shit lol that was morbid. Seriously people of reddit can anyone give me any advice ? I am aware that I am like the biggest waste of space but could there maybe be a place out there for me somewhere? I'm so tired of being miserable. I feel as if I'm probably the most miserable person on this planet. I wish something, anything could spark enough joy in me to make me want to get out of bed.",1

1780,"Being invisible is not a power. It's a disadvantage. : I figured out that a human can be invisible. Not physically invisible to the point where u cant see yourself, no, this invisible layer is different.When this certain person turns invisible to society they get ignored, someone only talks to them if they need something, and whenever they go to sit with a group of people they at some point get up and leave not asking if that invisible person wants to come with.Yep you guessed it, I'm talking about me, and whoever else suffers from this, it sucks. Knowing that your alone all the time, knowing that the words âyour not aloneâ?aren't true, it hurts.To be invisible. Usually looked at as a super power, for me I see it as a disadvantage, a struggle, a cry for help, a problem. People don't realise what they are doing to these suffering bodies but they also don't realise what they aren't either. What they are doing; ignoring, not including. What people  aren't doing; helping them. You may be against my belief that people don't help those people in need, if you think this then you don't see my point. My point is that just saying âyour not aloneâ?and then ignoring them the next day is apparently called âhelpingâ? what a big fat cover up, only trying to make it look like they're helping.  I don't want people to reply to this text telling me âeverything is okâ?that I should âstop being so downâ?because those words will never change my thoughts, only actions will.  I believe the more you give a pep talk to someone the more it makes that person hurt, why?

1816,"My girlfriend is thinking about cutting and I'm not sure how to go about this topic : Hey guys,So I'll just give a little background (theres not much that needs to be said really). I'm a M18 and she's a F16 and we are about 2 months into our official relationship after talking for about 2 months beforehand. She has told me about having insecurities about her body and how she wishes for a better ______(body part like legs or waist). She has told me about how she's had issues of comparison and feelings of inferiority with numerous other girls about body image and social standing and other things. She has told me she hates herself numerous times and she jokes about wanting to kill herself (which almost everyone does though idk i just thought I should ad even though thats a different topic entirely). She also tends to have severe anxiety (or something) attacks where her chest starts to hurt and he breathing starts getting really fast. In an effort to be there for her I've tried to do the following things (these are the main things i keep in mind when addressing these topics with her in conversation or in action alike):- make it known that I am always here to talk to her at about anything at all, and that i will do anything and everything to support her when she's feeling down.- actually be there for her lol, giving her lots of hugs and other forms of affection. Being literally a shoulder to lean on if she needs it.- make sure that when we talk about it I focus on her and why she feels the way she feels and just like trying to understand her feelings (and in the process of doing so allowing her to reflect on her feelings to i guess). Also making sure to try to not tell her how it makes me feel because its really not about me and guilt could cause her to maybe shut me out or something-making sure i dont treat her any differently than if she didn't have these thoughts so no random (âhow are you feelingâ?etc...)- and I've told no one aside from this anonymous reddit post which is also actually my first ever!Now I'd be lying if i said I haven't messed up with doing/keeping those things (in mind). I have talked too much in conversations about this and i have said things in ways that were insensitive to her which she has thankfully been able to forgive. I've kind of just been approaching this by feel and just what feels right given the circumstances presented before me. Also, this is my first time experiencing being around someone this close who has these kinds of thoughts and feelings and further it's just a really sensitive topic as we all know. I was just looking for tips or inspiration or just anything that you guys think would help me in this. Any pointers on what I could say or do when she tells me about feeling about self harm or when shes down? Is there something im not doing that I should be doing? Is there something im doing that I shouldn't be doing? I love her a lot and I really want her to be happy and not be sad or have any of these thoughts/feelings but at the same time i dont think its anybody's job nor is it in anyones ability to change someone else but i just want to be able to do everything i can to be there for her in this.Thanks to anyone who responds! You are all loved â¤ï¸",2

I've had a lot of great periods in my life where I achieved things I'm still proud of to this day, but none of which had anything to do with a new year's resolution. If you wanna change your life, you can start right now. And if you fucked up today, start tomorrow, not next year. Where I live, NYE has passed, and guess what, I spent it alone, and I'm happy about it. I learned that the best friendship one can ever have is a friendship with oneself. So learn how to enjoy your company. The most important thing is to love yourself, because you've been there for yourself all along and you deserve your love. One last thing I'll say is that you should stop looking at what other people are doing. People can and will do whatever their hearts desire, and that's none of our business. They can do whatever they want because we will do whatever we want too.",2

But things between us have gotten better, and I completed the tests I studied for (though I'm on to writing essays now), and I'm really thankful that things at least look better than they were. I'm hoping that 2020 can somehow bring more peace to my life than 2019 did, and I'm thankful for that chance.",2

1878,"Advice: How to Keep Up With Responsibilities? : Hey everyone. This year I'm going to aim for keeping up with my chores and getting into a healthier routine. My room is one of my biggest issues. I always let my room become an absolute disaster with clothes (dirty and clean), trash, and everything I own will be scattered. It seems easy to say just keep up with it everyday, but we all know with mental illness that picking up one object off of the floor feels like 50 pounds of sadness sits on your back. Any tips on how to handle responsibilities and a healthy routine? I've tried a checklist idea (wake up, make bed, brush teeth, eat breakfast, etc.) but never follow through with it. Thanks guys.",2

I've dealt with depression and anxiety when I was like 8th grade but I just realized that I have it when I was 10th grade. That time there was a lot of things happened and it was too much for me to take it in . I even gave up about the things I usually enjoy the most like drawing or play some computer games and just spend all my free time crying alone in my room for 2 straight hours. I was devasted to know that my teacher tried to call my parents to tell them that I was failing all of my classes. The end for me was really near because when I knew it happened, I was ready to take my own life since I've disappointed people that I truly care about. Years passed, I manage to stand up on my own and had less problems. I'm kind of proud of myself because I'm still alive even though I've been wanting to give up in life because I really thought I didn't have any purpose here but gratefully, I gave it a chance. I'm also thankful for my friends who had given me advices the time when I was so deflated and lastly, my boyfriend who is trying his best to give me the love and assurance I needed and it really helped a lot to cope with my problems.Reflecting about your mistakes helps too. You can't travel back in time but you should at least make a move to correct your mistakes you've done in the past. and I really do hope you all could get the help you needed.",2

1882,"Randomly stopped Zoloft : Hey all, I've been on Zoloft/Sertraline since 2010. Was on 100mg for many years until about 6 months ago, when I stopped cold turkey. Obviously this made me go off the rails, so after consulting my therapist, I went back to taking the pills but started off at 25mg for two weeks and then went up to 50mg. My therapist said it didn't sound like I needed to up my dosage anymore. Then I had a good few weeks and stupidly thought I didn't need the pills again anymore. So again I stopped taking them. Now I'm regretting that decision. I have an appointment with my therapist in a couple of weeks, but in the meantime I am wondering if I should start again with 50mg or start the process over again with 25mg.

1896,"How to deal better with depression and sources of meaning i found :  A string of thoughts i wrote for myself after 8 years of existential depression""Meaning can be obtained through pleasurethrough a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,through attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,through accepting social responsibility, social rolesthrough believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or otherfrom waiting for technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerationsIf there isnt one , make one ,because psychologically you need it; you need to feel like a person with worth in a world with meaning or else your brain will short circuit and inhibit your behaviour,so as to not waste energy. It could be anything that makes workthile the suffering life brings.Speaking of worth , self esteem's biggest component is social conparison,usually this manifests unconsciously in behaviour, your happiness will always be relative to others'- achievements and lives-if left unscrutonized.Life can be seen in the positive light like this: as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high , to make love,or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day; you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,a result of a rare set of circumstances ,with an even rarer, goldy locke- like set of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist,becoming alive is rare.You live in the best time, historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,the life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences andÂ  sensations,the most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice times,all the human knowledge at your fingertips,psychedelics etc.life is linear from 0 to 0Â  ,whatever you do, in the end doesnt matter,but, since you shouldntÂ  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ;you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter.Â  If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because its unrealistic,you are just thrown in a context when youre born,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people joust for position just to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy,if you have realistic expectations ,extracted of wishful thinking.This is especially hard for cerebral people,who are terrorized by the limits reality and how the world could be ,if people were different. First off my advice is to accept the world fully then try to change the world by being a good parent,child,friend etc.There is nothing youre going to be doing, thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works, aside from your own perceptions +use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to,dont waste your life ruminating on shit that only makes you feel bad, even if youre correct,its not a pragmatic worldview.Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed.Study neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in , to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intense than the pleasure of really achieveing it, in order so you keep striving; it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving, you must run as fast as you can , to remain in the same place.Learn about the psychological article( bad is stronger than good),and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible).Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss, at each throw the chance is 50â?it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row, it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.One of our species superpowers, is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations ,-we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).""death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy""life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and youre probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts, that will get you to extract as much out of this ,journey/chance as possible and not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable, and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions, of some life episodes, shouldnt necesarilly be generalised.""",2

1901,"Embrace yourselfâ¤ï¸ : It's important to deal with your feelings and emotions, because they give you depth like nothing else can in this universe. They are the thing that makes you alive. Don't lose touch with your emotions. Embrace them, welcome them because they are the realest thing you will ever experience.To experience pleasure you need to feel unhappy, unsatisfied and depressed. If you would always feel pleasured, there would be no point in the existence of pleasure. See, the concept of darkness can't exist with its opposite concept of light, because without light there would be no way to experience darkness. The same thing applys to the concept of feeling.So don't fear depression, welcome it because it means the existence of pleasure.I've been trough depression by myself and I know how hard it can be sometimes. Sometimes you feel like you want to die, to be ereased out of reality. You wish you were never born into existence. But that's ok, because it doesn't matter, nothing matters after all. Don't take life too serious, it's a game which is meant to be played, which is mean to be enjoyed. So then if anyone is judging you right now, you feel anxious or insecure, I say it's okay, because you're being loved.âMan suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for funâ?- Alan Watts",2

There's a spark in you somewhere. Dig it out, whatever it takes, there are no rules. Respect to you all for the new year. *You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it--it's the*   *only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks*   *your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually*   *drunk.*   *But on what?Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be*   *drunk.*   *And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of*   *a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again,*   *drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave,*   *the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything*   *that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is*   *singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and*   *wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you:""It is time to be*   *drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, be*  *continually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish.""*                             [Charles Baudelaire](https://www.poemhunter.com/charles-baudelaire/poems/)",2
1943,Day 3: Happy that I don't feel so down when I wake up now cos I'm seeing some morning messages from a special friend. I hope the down feeling wont appear this New Year. : re: I decided to do post my journal here after I was diagnosed with depression. Writing this everytime I wake up.The down feeling goes on and off but I realized how helpful your social circle are...most of the time. Not making today's post long just wish that I'll be busy enough to divert the negative feeling for the rest of the day.Happy New Year! ð,2
1944,"New decade, new life. : Last ten years? Fuck em! Fuck 2010 - 2019. The 20's are ours! I hope everyone that reads this has a better 10 years than the last. Shits gotta get better otherwise why are we still here? We're for eachother.  We vent to eachother to know we matter or at least that someone cares or knows how we feel. Here's to surviving the next ten years and not giving into that bullshit depression. I hope you guys find that thing that gives your life meaning. Stay strong, you got this shit!",2
1945,"I hate New Year's Eve, I hate Christmas : Fuck these holidays. They always remind me of how lonely I am. Always reminds me of how dysfunctional my family is. Always reminds me how depression can ruin these holidays more for me. Ugh. I wish I could enjoy these celebrations like normal people.",2
1946,"Don't think I'm gonna get better : I just can't, there's so much brain fog I can't think clearly my brain is in a million pieces I can't get over the past I can't focus on anything in the future. I'm just wasting my days away feeling worse each day, fuck the new year too.",2
1947,"[Resident Physician] Horribly depressed, months after failing to match for residency :  I knew I wanted to be an ER doctor early on in med school. Volunteered as a scribe and fell in love with the ER. The people, the pace, the environment just really clicked for me. I did what every Emergency Medicine-bound med student in the US is supposed to do. I did some away rotations, got my letters. Maybe I should have applied more broadly to more residency programs in retrospect but I applied to a substantial number of programs. My application, by all accounts, was fine. I went to a reputable state MD school, did OK on board exams with solid scores and no failures, and supposedly my letters of rec (called SLOEs in the EM world) were good. Went on enough interviews that according to official data my chances of not matching were less than 3%. Made my rank list Come March 2019, and I found out I was part of that 3%. I didn't match. I was devastated. I have been ever since. I was lucky in that I was able to scramble into a 1-year prelim program. I'm currently reapplying to Emergency Medicine this cycle. On track to have the same overall number of interviews this year. Was I just a shitty interviewee last year? Did I interview better this year? Was there some hidden red flag on my application? Who the fuck knows. The only certainty in this hellish game is that I'll find out if I match on March 16, 2020, but statistically, reapplicants to the [Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program) fare worse than fresh grads.So if I fail to match again, then what? If you don't get a residency in x specialty (one year preliminary programs like the one I'm currently in don't count) you can't work as a full attending physician in that specialty. Specifically, if you don't do an Emergency Medicine residency no one will hire you to work in a tier-one city ER. Maybe I might fare better in the Match if I also applied to different, less competitive specialties like Family Medicine or Internal Medicine, but I pretty much dislike everything else in medicine and to be specific, I hate everything to do with primary care (Family Medicine) and working as an inpatient hospitalist or subspecialist (Internal Medicine). If you fail to match you get the option of immediately trying to scramble (called the SOAP process) into an open position, but guess what specialties most of those unfilled openings are in? Yep, IM and FM. And usually these unfilled spots are at shitty programs (there's a reason why they didn't fill, after all.) It's just doubly depressing and I'm fairly sure I would off myself if I had to work as an IM or FM doctor for the rest of my shitty miserable life.I've never had a history of mental illness but the uncertainty of my future and the thought of not matching again just depresses me horribly. The more I ruminate about it the more I want to kill myself, and I certainly have the means to thanks to my 9mm handgun. As part of my current prelim year I have to do rotations in fields that have very little to do with Emergency Medicine (like my current inpatient hospitalist rotation) and to have to go to work for that every day is an internal torture for me. I've always been very good at compartmentalizing my emotions and feelings so thankfully no one at work has any idea of how I feel. Pretty sure they would force me to be hospitalized if anyone found out (which obviously would not be good for my future residency prospects). But I'm convinced that if I fail to match again on March 16, 2020 (when the results for the 2020 match come out), I will just kill myself. For one, anyone who has failed to match twice is going to be damaged goods and there's little chance you'll be competitive for \*any\* residency if you try to match again the next year. There just won't be anything worth living for anymore. Having a medical degree without residency is near useless and to enter just about any decent field outside of medicine would require starting from scratch with a huge pay cut too. My medical career was going so well, only for most of it to be suddenly destroyed in March 2019. We will find out if whatever remains can be salvaged on March 16, 2020 at 11 AM EST, and if I get to continue on my journey to become an ER doctor.If not...these remaining two months will be my last.",2
1948,"would a therapist accept me, or am I overthinking? : ummm well maybe I'm just in a bad mood right now but this mood comes up a few times a month so I guess I'll share.hobbies are good for nothing more than killing time. as a teenager I loved creative writing but now when I do it it's more out of habit than any love, passion, or enjoyment.I don't really understand people who look forward to things - I used to! but, well...I genuinely believe life is no more meaningful than just killing time and busying yourself until you get to die.I do laugh and have love a lot. I genuinely don't believe I'm depressed. I function well, wake up consistently, study hard and get good grades. not much of a choice on that front, but I know depression is crippling when it comes to things like that.I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to find enjoyment or passion in... well, anything?I consider my view on life a little nihilistic even though I'm regularly and known to be goofy, loud, and outspoken.even the shows and books and stuff that I think I love don't really trigger much emotion in me. happy or sad. I feel like any reaction I have to my friends (like: ""GOD IM SO SAD ABOUT [chapter]"") is 100% habit.TLDR: i dont really feel much enjoyment, purpose,  or strong emotions at all, but i function well and am a goofy person. is there a chance i could get medical help for this despite not being depressed?",2
1949,How loud do I have to cry for help for someone to hear me? : I'm practically screaming. Why can't no one see I'm not okay? Do I hide it that well? My depression is worse than it's ever been and I don't know how long I can continuing fighting a war I know I'll never win...,2
1950,"My Story : I forgot to take my meds and I can't get to them as I'm staying at a friend's and it would mean waking them up, so I am stuck awake until I leave to go back to London tomorrow at 11am-ishThis year has been probably my toughest ever. I've been trying to come to terms with the ending of a really special friendship between a couple and I, a whole group of friends due to lies being spread about me that included my best friend I made on the fetish scene and two friends died, one to suicide and one to a heart attack. I was made redundant from the first job I have had last longer than a year and a half since 2008 due to moving my role outside of London, I've had problems and uncertainty over my living situation and culminating in my Dad having a heart attack about two weeks before Christmas.In the last six months, I've I purposely asked my therapist to start trying to help me come to terms with my own abuse, but unfortunately, my own mental health went down the more we spoke about it. This was around June time and around that time I met my now ex play partner. As I am on the fetish and BDSM scene, having a play partner is kind of like a FWB but you meet up, hang out, ""play"", have sex, whatever... Problem being, I pretty much fell for her the moment I saw her.She is everything I want in a partner, funny, cute, curvy, into the same music (BIG BIG THING for me) and into the same kinks, even the ones I am ashamed of / scared of sharing with others. She always said she wasn't over her ex and didn't want anything serious but with her being exactly what I want in someone, I couldn't help but fall for her. She is literally only the second person ever in my life that when I met for the first time, my heart skipped a beat and I felt like my jaw dropped like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf.She pulled away from me twice through kink guilt and then the final time happened in mid-Oct, I didn't realise how serious it was and how much it really was over for a few weeks afterwards when she told me she had feelings for someone else. This was the lynchpin that when it was pulled away, started my breakdown. I broke down to my housemate's girlfriend and sobbed my heart out so hard and for so long, my other housemates came to find out what had happened. I ended up in such a panicked state, I had to call the Samaritans for help. I ended up calling a few different helplines to try and get somewhere but it didn't amount to much.I ended up going to the Accident and Emergency (ER to the US readers) because I was so low, I was worried I would do something stupid. They didn't do much but eventually, they referred me to the brief intervention team... which I only heard from after a series of shitty and frustrating events. I have spoken to doctors and spoken with a clinical psychologist now and they've referred me to a psychiatrist but STILL waiting on this too.I still talk her occasionally but she's super short in her answers and it just hurts. I've only seen her once to give her belongings back, but any time she puts on update on the website we met through or her IG, I get anxious and upset, but I can't unfollow / delete / block because something in me isn't ready to let go. She's everything I want in someone I just can't bear to think that I could miss out on being with her. We'll end up running into each other at some events eventually but I know I will have to leave because it will hurt too much.I honestly don't know what to do. I'm lost, so lonely, I feel ugly, I'm overweight and no one wants to be with me and no one EVER wants to be with me how I want to be with them.Since I broke up with my wife at the start of 2015, I have had about eight partnerships but none were anything serious, no matter how much I wanted them to be. It's been ten years since I have felt like I was getting what I needed from a relationship and I'm lonelier that I have ever been. I have some better tools to cope with the down times that I did before but I'm still hurting so so much and I just want a ray of sunshine, someone that makes my heart skip, someone to show me the love I want to give them, but no one I want to be with, wants me, they never have and I feel like they never will.I was a really late bloomer in school and I didn't start having relationships till I was 15 plus and then didn't have consensual sex till I was 17 plus and the only reason I did end up dating people and such was because they were the first people to come along and show interest in me. I honestly ended up in relationships with people who were bad for me from the start for the pure reason that they showed interest and somewhere in my \*\*\*\*ing brain just went ""QUICK! DON'T TURN THEM DOWN! YOU'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE!""I'm just so so tired, so lonely, so upset and so scared that I'll never be happy again. I don't want my Dad to die before he know I have someone who loves me and I love them. My parents are in their 70's now and they are starting to show real signs of aging and losing either of them could really be the end of me.Sorry, this post has gone all over the place, just very tired (mentally) and just want someone there to hold me, to give me a kiss, gently stroke my back as they pass me while out with a group of friends, just anything to know that someone cares enough to touch me. I need contact with people, if I were to see friends 99% of the day for a week, but had to physical contact, I might as well have been alone, because I need it to fell like someone cares and right now, no matter how many screenshots I save from those that reply to my posts, no matter how many phone calls, whatsapp's or whatever, nothing can replace that contact, especially from someone that I want to be with and they want to be with meJust wish things were very very different. Thank you for reading.... Safe journeys",2
1951,OMG! It's Thursday already? : The days seem to stream by without me noticing.  DAE find that depression steals days or even weeks?   I try to put all appointments on my phone with a 3 hour alarm (so that it lets me know 3 hours before) but I still miss some.  Appointments which seem weeks or even months away come and go and I don't even realize.  It's scary.,2
1952,Making the choice : Sometimes depression really is just a big game and it is all about mentality. It is so hard to make the decision to not give up and to not talk down to yourself. Sometimes i make the choice that I am going to start taking care of myself because I deserve to feel good an healthy but it is so hard to stay in that mindset and so easy to stay unmotivated and just want to fall deeper and deeper into depression. Sometimes I decide i'm not going to care about trying to be happy and I am going to push everyone away to protect myself and because my mind likes to tell me no one cares when people really do. I decide i am not going to talk to anyone and should just accept my suffering and bask in it. It is so easy to not want to do anything to feel better but there is other options and it begins with making the choice to care about myself,2

Not one of them pays rent or takes out the trash.And I love them, unconditionally. I would die for them. They are the best thing that ever happened to me, period. I look forward to seeing them every day. They make me smile and laugh and I love to make them smile and laugh. They give me purpose. They make me want to be a better person. They make me want to conquer my depression.Are you a burden? Probably not. But do you feel like a burden? Almost certainly. And you know what? Who fucking cares. Someone out there loves you unconditionally, even if you're a burden. Someone would die for you, even if you're a burden. Do you know that people take care of each other? That we love each other?

His parents already knew how suicidal he was in his past but didn't know about how he felt about taking his own life recently.  I was scared to tell anyone about, he told me not to tell his parents about it, I wanted to, but I kept his promise.

I know many other people have depressions and other struggles, but to see their thoughts and feelings written out was something else entirely. It just made me want to say if you haven't yet, reach out and try and get the help you need...the help we all need. Talk to friends and family about what you're going through. Seek out therapy. Maybe consider taking medication. Go out and challenge those dark thoughts we all live with. These were all things I did in the last few years, and while we all know there's no cure for this, it makes things even the tiniest bit easier. Even on your most hopeless days, it can give you a leg to stand on. Like I said, I've never been on this subreddit before, so I'm sorry if I broke any rules or offended anyone.

1971,"I declared my love to her on NYE : It's no secret that I'm in love with this woman. I know it, she knows it, and anyone who has ever seen us together knows it. Like, it's an established fact. I'm smitten and absolutely hypnotized, and she's so far out of my league.We're not together, like something is causing us each to hesitate, like we make each other nervous (wrong word?). It's like we're doing this dance around each other, and it's confusing, infuriating and exciting all at once.Large crowds cause me severe anxiety, and I'm prone to depression, so naturally a group of us went out on NYE. Downtown in a huge city. We're in a bar, and she looks at me like she does and I melt. I'm far too drunk to make good decisions, but I lean in where only she can hear and tell her, ""This may ruin everything, and I'm sorry - I am completely in love with you."" I had to get it out, as unnecessary as it really was.She hugged me really hard for a long time. Then I lost my mind. Panic attack, overwhelmed by the number of people suddenly, combined with an unfair amount of alcohol in my system, I disappeared into the crowd.When she and our group found me I was 2 miles away, lost, crying, and unable to speak or move. When I could speak, it was single words that were self-deprecating. I'm not sure why I broke down - again, I didn't say anything that wasn't already known - but it's like the act of vocalizing it shattered my universe somehow before I even got a reaction.For a couple of hours I sat there trying to get control of myself back. And she never left my side, never stopped trying to help me be okay, for the rest of the night.I've spent every minute since then second guessing myself. The depression hit for no reason and I started beating myself up. It's been full throttle anxiety all day. She has been so reassuring, trying to make me understand that everything is okay. It has taken me 24 hours to accept it.I have my doubts. I showed the ugly side of me and who in their right mind stays around after that?Internet, based on everything I've said, tell me: does this woman love me?",2

Thanks &amp; i hope you're all having a good day :) So, I know everyone always says not to rely on others for happiness, but I find it literally impossible. I have hardly any friends anyways, but when I have a falling out with one of them or if I get ghosted by someone I develop a âfriendshipâ?with online etc, I fall into the worst state of depression for DAYS. It sounds really sad, I know, but does anyone else have this same problem where you just feel like you can't be happy or even feel decent without talking to friends or a romantic partner? Or any ideas on how to cope with feeling sad without having to rely on talking to my friends? I've gotten suggestions like play video games, go to the gym, read a book, etc as suggestions to keep myself occupied, but none of those really help me, unfortunately ): Also, another thing; how do some of you guys cope with being ghosted by someone that you really enjoyed talking to &amp; felt a connection with? For me it's difficult to just get over it because I get attached to new people/friends suuuper easily and it sucks because internet friendships only really last so long for the most part before you either get ghosted entirely or just fall out of contact. It's part of the whole âtrying not to rely on othersâ?thing for me, because when i get ghosted by someone it hurts and depresses the fuck outta me for a long ass time.Any advice and or help would be much appreciated!Thanks for reading if you made it this far. *TLDR: How should I try and cope with not feeling so depressed without relying on talking to friends to keep me âhappyâ? That's usually the only thing that stops me from breaking down is talking to one of the (few) friends that I still have. Would appreciate some advice/suggestions. Thanks!*",2

And I broke down and I cried and he kept telling me I need to act like an adult. I get it might be frustrating to hear me say those things,  so I deserve it.

2003,"Something beautiful I found in YouTube comments and just thought you want to see it : Here it goes:Kyle Broussard1 year agoThe most depressed people always seem the happiest around people they know, and usually show love in the most unconditional ways - except towards themselves. Always remember this. When you meet someone who goes out of the way to help everyone, don't take it for granted, because they are usually the first ones to leave this world way too early. Just pull them aside and let them know it's alright and that we are all lost here. That's all they need, is just recognition that someone sees what they are going through and can see through all the bullshit that doesn't matter, and truly connect with them - even if just for a second - to have a human moment. Even subtle eye contact can do it. Just don't let these folks rot inside without at least trying to connect. Cuz they are the people we need to make positive changes in this world. Depression is no joke, and it often plagues the most intelligent minds - for to them, they are alone. Cast away in a world where only they see the wrong, and everyone is so focused on dumb shit that they can't connect even for a second. And all they want is to be loved. To legitimately wake up and feel like someone needs them to exist. They need this more than other people, because they do not often love themselves. They have the most doubts, regrets, questions, and the least feeling of self purpose. They realize their lack of universal relevance and do not attribute any sense of ownership - and therefore achievement behind most of what the rest of the world deems to be success. To them, success comes not from the outside world of money or women or drugs or fam or power, but from within. But without the knowledge of what it is they seek to complete themselves, they are able to accomplish many more feats than their peers, and yet still feel empty inside even once they have achieved monumental accomplishments, while most are content with a TV show and a bowl of ice cream. They continually question their purpose - which fuels their creative minds, but if unchecked can lead to self ruin. Maybe find some time in between checking your phone for notifications about sports and watching drama shows on your TV to give them a call and say you love them. It might just be what keeps them on this planet.Taken from Mac Miller - Conversation pt. 1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcXhpgHwvI) sorry, on mobileI just thought I can brighten up someone's day as it did mine, be strong yall.",2

2027,"Only one way out... : So im a nursing student who just got placed at a pediatric mental health institute and honestly it scares the shit outta me. There are 9 year olds that are taking medications for depression and even 12 year olds that want to kill themselves. I wonder how these kids havent even started life and they are already hating it. It honestly sucks. Tbh I went through a period of time where I was depressed as well but its scary to even think what these children have went through or are going through that brought them to this horrendous place. I hate calling the sadness that I went through ""depression"" because that word just triggers me to think of everything that is wrong with me. I coped through my sad times by turning to religion but I know not everyone is like me. I dont even know how to help these kids and I dont think stuffing them with drugs prescribed by the doctor will ever help. It hurts me everyday to see them because I wish I had the power to rewire their brains and make them see the goodness in life. Life is a constant struggle and is not a place I like either, but that doesnt mean you should just quit. You need to keep going. You need to find one thing and try to get to it. Just one goal. It is hard when you wake up and you dont even want to get up, just starting your day by wishing you died in your sleep, but trust me, one day you will like something about life. And you will die in the end which may make it seem like you are just living for no end goal or purpose, but I believe I am not working for this world but the afterlife, and even if you dont believe in this, just try to make it your goal to make others lives better and make others happy before you die. No amount of money will ever make you happy if your not happy with yourself. So push yourself and cry and keep going. Sacrifice yourself for others and dont expect nothing in return. The smile you give to others by tearing yourself apart will give you comfort, and hopefully make you smile one day. And if it doesnt...i might come visit you and make you smile ð",2

2040,"00:00 zero o clock : I've been listening to the new BTS album and usually it takes me a long while til I look up the English translation. When I do though, it's always relevant to how I'm feeling. They really do write uplifting lyrics. Nothing overly bearing and cheesy. Take a look at this first verse: You know those daysThose days where you're sad for no reasonThose days where your bodyâisâheavyAnd it looksâlike everyone else except you isâbusy and fierceMy feet won't set off, though it seems like I'm already too lateI'm hateful of the whole worldIsn't all of this relatable? A constant feeling of sadness, some known reasons, some unknown. And as I live day by day, these feelings linger and life just feels pointless. Next verse: Come home and lie in bedThinking if it was my fault?Dizzy night, looking at the clockSoon it will be midnightWill something be different?It won't be something like thatBut this day will be overWhen the minute and second hands overlapThe world holds its breath for a little whileZero o'clockLife feels pointless and I could say I'm hopeless but apart of me always says âtomorrowâ?âtomorrow will be betterâ?âI will start ____ tomorrowâ? It's all a little white lie but a glimmer of hope for myself to continue is good enough for me. Anyway this song makes me feel like it's okay to feel the way I feel. Tomorrow is a new day and I can try again. These feelings aren't going to disappear within a night. Anyway I do suggest listening to their music. My favorite song is paradise which is along the same premise: it's ok not to have a dream or force myself to have this extravagant hopefulness/ dream like others. It's okay to live day by day and conquer little things in life. Note: idk what they're saying since I don't speak fluent korean but it sounds good and picking up a couple phrases has been fun to learn. Just believe the message they're conveying!",2
2041,"I am once again asking for your help : None of the cookie cutter shit, please. I appreciate it but I would strongly prefer answers that will help me get closer to the subject matter.I've been researching this on and off for months. It seems to be, at least in the US/UK, strictly limited to the (physically) terminally ill - assisted suicide, that is. Euthanasia is illegal here in the US, period. I'm from the upper east coast and have no such options, am in average to below average physical health, but have lived with lifelong depression among other things. I would like to pass with some dignity rather than miserably clinging onto something I consider meaningless. I literally only live because it would emotionally inconvenience my immediate family and friends. I'd prefer to leave the most shallow emotional scar I possibly can and to leave my physical imprint similarly shallow (my personal belongings being packaged up/easy to dispose of or store, etc.).If there are no options in the US I am considering overseas options, even if that requires I become a citizen. In the Netherlands or Switzerland it is a 5-year or so process, which in hindsight is nothing to fret about. The grind and dedication to achieve the means to the end is comforting enough.Ultimately I'd like to make as little a mess as possible as a hanging death via doorknob and a drug cocktail is nothing I would like to leave anyone cleaning up. If it becomes my only option then very well, but I'd like to go with dignity and at least leave my loved ones better prepared.",2

2043,"The change that brought me out of depression. [long, hopefully inspiring] : I was a good college student, but overwhelmed because of the intensity of the material I studied. As graduation approached, I managed to land a job (not degree related) that paid pretty well coming out of school. I thought I was set. Then the work began, the job wasn't horrible, but it was stressful and exhaustive. the days were long...10-12 hour days, Monday through Friday. After a year I realized I'm spending most of my time at work, and doing very little outside of it. Stopped going to the gym, starting eating like shit, hardly ever saw my friends, hell I hardly had friends to begin with. You know what, scratch that, I DIDN'T realize it at the time, but that's what was happening and that's how it always fucking begins...you let that life giving force slip away from you unnoticed. Anyway, I started applying elsewhere within the same industry. My thinking was, I'll give this industry another shot and if it's the same BS, I'm out, I'll do something else entirely ...what that was at the time, I didn't know, I didn't really have a long term plan. I landed another job, more money, similar title, same exhaustive hours, different company, in a Big city, which prompted me to move out which was exciting. Everything was new and that new energy powered me through the first new year on the job. And then the lack of realization struck again, i was being groomed for a life time of suffering. At the time, what I DID realize is that This is just how life goes...you graduate and then work yourself half to death. I was putting in so much work and neglecting myself entirely. The job was great at masking my neglect. They'd have work parties, music playing, TVs everywhere playing the news, sports, etc. food was provided, we had a bar, mini golf, pool tables, the works. The idea was that you go to work and you shouldn't feel like you're there, which was a great concept...but still, I had no life. This company bought my life. I became a shell, I'd come home, pound 3-4 beers and surf the couch til bed time. I was irritable, annoyed and lazy, depressed. Once the weekend came...I was dead to the world. Friday I was too tired to go out, Saturday was my only day to catch up on anything at all, and Sunday ...Sunday...man, that was the day that never failed to remind me that...hey your life sucks. Sunday was the day of dread, I didn't want to do anything because I knew that the next day, my suffering resumed. I became depressed. So so depressed. I continued this for two years, I burned out. I was a drone. I lived to work and nothing else. I lost. I felt useless, worthless, watching life zoom by. I became out of shape, unhealthy, lazy, mean, sad. Then one day, at a family party on a Sunday, I left early and on the drive home I found the courage to change it all. I said to myself âI want out, I want changeâ?not just any change, positive change. Nobody should have to live this way. The next day I showed up at work and put in the utmost minimal amount of work possible, all the while applying for any and every other possible job out there. It was then that I reconnected with a former college friend who seemed to have a great job in an industry suited to my degree. She said she'd put in a word for me and that was that. Within two months, my life changed so dramatically, I cried tears of happiness. The job is awesome, caters to work/life balance, and it's just good. I have my life back, I'm healthy again, in the best shape of my life, doing the things I want to do. The only downside was that I took a 22% salary cut to do this, but in the two years I've been here I've made up for more than half of that already. Besides, I learned that no amount of money can buy my happiness. I've been the happiest I've ever been making less than my previous two jobs. I'm still here, thriving, happy and looking forward to the future. My example is obviously very specific but here is what you should take away from this:Take a step back and observe your life, there is something there that doesn't belong and hone in on it, change it. It can be something small or something as big as changing careers and flipping your life upside down temporarily. Things get tougher before they get better, but we're humans and we're capable of suffering. If you're suffering now, you can take a little more if the result brings about positive change. It's fucking scary, but nothing will change if you don't try. We deserve the best, but the best starts with respecting yourself and changing the life around you.Best of luck. You got this.",2

I've tried to but she just pushes me away, especially my mom. She won't speak to my mom at all. My mom recently started home schooling her because she hated going to school she would miss so many days but would still manage to get good grades because she's always been such a good student with good grades. My mom is confused and heart broken because she doesn't know how to help either and she's still in denial about her depression. She doesn't understand it. My sister won't get out of her bedroom and it worries me. She's in there all the time with no light. She has it locked all the time and I just found out she stopped doing her homework.

2064,"I can't talk to my friends or family and I really need to let some stuff out. : A while ago I realized how much I dislike every aspect of my life.  Everything in my life that is supposed to bring me happiness is majorly flawed.  I'm not going to get into every single aspect, just the main ones that have been paining my lately. Every one of my friendships has a major key missing. Dont get me wrong, I love my friends, and I would do anything for them.  But it has been years since I've felt true love and happiness around anybody.  Most of the time I am around someone I want to be home.  Something is missing in every friendship.  Every.  Single.  Friendship.  It's different for everyone and I wont get into it for every specific person but it fucks me up.  I want to feel comfortable and happy with someone.  Truly comfortable and happy.  Like wanting to spend hours with them, feeling heard and understood, feeling the way it feels when your love is reciprocated fully.  And this is why I cant talk to my friends about this.  I cant hurt them.  I cant tell them that I think our friendship is flawed or that I dont really feel at home with them.  Thats horrible.  But sometimes I think they can feel it.  And it sucks even more.  I talk to them and I can see it in their eyes.  They can see I'm not totally happy being with them and it hurts them.  And it hurts me to know I make them feel that way.  It's an endless cycle.  like I said, it's been years since I've felt fully platonically in love with a friend. And  I feel so disconnected from my family.  I'm the odd one out.  It's like I got put into my own personal hell.  I am nothing like these people.  And I'm stuck with them for years to come.  You're supposed to feel loved and supported and happy with your family.  They've broken my heart so many times.  I've just learned to keep to myself. It hurts not even get along with your family.  It hurts so bad.  I know the next 5 years of my life are going to be so lonely, sad, and stressful.  I might not make it.  My heart has been broken, and I mean I can feel the pain in my heart, so many times.  By my friends, by my family, by people i have been romantically interested in.  I dont know how it hasnt just died.  I know that sounds dramatic, but it has felt so much pain.  And to top it all off, I lost the one person who I felt slightly connected to.  Still off by a long shot, but closer than anyone I've ever known.  She turned into someone I couldnt stand to be around, and it hurt.  It still hurts.  I had to distance myself.  Everytime Ive spoken to her in the last year i hope for someone who isnt there, and it breaks my heart every time.  She became mean and vindictive and selfish.  Now I feel truly alone. I hate to feel this way so young.  I honestly wish I could just end it all.  I am a realist, and I just wish people would let me do it. I know the next 5 years, and possibly the rest of my life are going to be a sad waste.  I wish people would put their emotion aside and let me do it.  It would save me and everyone else so much heartache.  I wish I could get cancer. People cope easier with it, or at least better than a sudden abrupt death.  They wont have to wonder why I did it, they'll know it was the cancer, and that's good enough for me.  I really believe it's the best option, all emotions aside.  I wish I could get into everything, I wish I could talk to someone and let everything that is in my head out, but I cant.  It all boils down to one thing.  I truly believe I am not meant for this life.",2

My vacations just ended, i came home, my mom and dad were figthing because she just realized how bad we live, and so i did, our house is a mess, the walls are falling, when it rains the water enters the house, etc. It's not big deal for me because i'm used to live like this, but everytime i'm long gone from here and i come back, i just can't believe that we live like this.  My mom started to scream and insult my father, and even if she was right, it's traumatic to hear them figthing, it makes me feel horrible because i know My father is making everything bad.

I tried to be happy, to ignore this, but day by day it keeps getting worst.My only hope is that i will be out of here soon, one way or another. I wish i could help them, it hurts so much watching how everything turns worst and worst and you just can't make a difference, not in your life, and not in the life of them. The only thing that brings me some joy it's knowing that i will move in two years, because i will work very hard. I just want to be out of here, i can't live like this. I have no motivation, everyday is grey, empty, because this eats me inside. And i can't stop crying because sometimes i feel like this is so unfair, i'm tired of being tired, to not find a way to be happy, everything it's so hard, i choose it or not.

2074,"50% genetic, 40% lifestyle , 10% circumstance : If you believe in the science/ stats, then you know that what you're going through isn't permanent. 40% of your happiness is affected by choices and decisions in your life that YOU CAN INFLUENCE. A lot of people on this thread constantly ruminating on the bad times. If you wanna get better you need to get some serious positive influences in your life and make quantitative changes. Imagine thinking you're gonna fix your depression by listening to the thoughts and ideas of other depressed people. It makes no sense right? Here's some serious scientific-based advice from a psychology student.Top five tips to getting better; 1. Exercise, sleep, and diet. Not going to go into it all. But fucking do it. Not going to debate which diet is the healthiest either, but low sugar is a good place to start for all those soft drink enthusiasts.2. Socialise. Find people whose company you enjoy and click with. Cling to those people (not in a weird way). Foster those relationships. Friendships are hard, you need to put effort into them if you want them to work. That means messaging on a daily basis, organising weekly meetups, listening to them when they are struggling (and in turn them listening to you). If you have any antisocial addictions, make them social! Hard core gamers, get all over discord. Alcoholics, attend AA meetings (PLURAL). You get the drift. 3. Don't limit yourself in what you can and can't do due to the judgments of others (parents, friends, etc). Helplessness and lack of control is a depression complex on its own. Go get your motorbike license, or get that sick tattoo, or cross dress on a night out. Idc just go do it because you'll hate yourself for not. 4. Routine. Get yourself a routine. I cannot stress this enough. Getting out of bed is the hardest part of the day for some people. On my worst days, I'll make sure more than anything to brush my teeth. From there on out everything just flows. Shower-&gt; breakfast -&gt; Car -&gt; Work/Uni etc... I won't get into the psychology of it because it's extremely broad and long winded, I could do a whole ten thousand word thesis on it.(I couldn't but someone could, it's that extensive).5. Start a diary. Essential. Log your thoughts and emotions and how you responded to them. Was it healthy? We're you right in thinking / feeling that way? Depression is a very emotional state of being and a diary is a really productive way to rationalise all these intense thoughts and emotions running around in your head. Putting them down on paper also helps you talk about them later which is a really positive and healthy way of dealing with it all.So, five tips that you can start implementing into your life right now! If you start doing these things and don't see improvement, you're just as much of a statistical anomaly as Helen Keller. Gl have fun and let me know how it all goes.",2
2075,"overflowing with pain how do i stop even when ive come to a conclusion RANT : the other day i went to a family reunion which is usually something i look forward to as it is all fun and games during those times. One big part of my depression and stress is family and mainly my elder sister (three sisters, eldest sister is very supportive of me, and i am the youngest child) we got in a stupid little argument where she ended up raising her voice at me, and idk i never cry over stuff like that but i think everyhing ive carefully stacked on top of eachother finally came crashing down all at once. I didnt want to cry in front of all my cousins (who i love) so i walked to another room where my eldest sister was trying to take a nap. I dont know what i would have done if this hadnt been seperated like that and i think i am very lucky. I ended up sobbing in the dark for an hour while we talked about everyhting that has gone down and it was the most genuine conversation and i definitely needed it. and then my other sister had walked in only to yell at me more for being inconsiderate. We then all talked as siblings and i couldnt even speak for myself as i couldnt talk over my tears. She then said she wasnt grateful or something and said she wished she grew up with different friends, in a different house, and a different face. Honestly i think she is the pretty sister and it rly hurt and annoyed me when she had said that because i always felt below her and everyone looked at her cuz she was prettier. And saying she basically wasnt grateful for what we had which is one of the only things i live for, really pushed me over. We both appologized but it didnt feel genuine and thinking about it makes me teary eyed because the sense of over loading frustration just tipping over is utterly the worst. Even when we had came to a conclusion i can tell nothing has changed. I am super grateful for my eldest sister who prolly has had it the hardest with our parents and being the oldest, and i also feel helpess for bot being able to help her",2

When you dreamt of being a Marine, you watched on TV of the Americans fighting and said âI should be there to help themâ? when you dreamt of being a Police Officer you were being bullied and tormented, when you dreamt of being a Paramedic you saw horrible car accidents and mass shootings. This life you've lived through you've seen and witnessed horrible things and all you wanted to do was help. At the end of the day you would have never guessed that your future self fucked everything up by taking a drag of blunt. I sit in our room and remember the times we've curled under covers crying ourselves to sleep at night listening to our parents scream at each other and hearing horrible words and glass, walls and dressers breaking. As we'd lay there we silently screamed to ourselves that one day we would make it out of here and never look back once we left the front door. When you were little I remember when you'd play Army with your buddies on the school playground with the mindset of you actually doing it once day, when your buddies would get hurt you'd be the first on the scene trying to gather information about what happened and helping them to their feet and to the school nurse. But older you fucked it up... by taking a long drag of a blunt. The blunt doesn't taste to good now. I doubt in your naive young, smart and imaginative mind, that you, us, ourself, would be sitting on the edge of the bed sobbing into a pillow with a gun in your hand, the hammer cocked back and having it aimed to your head.

2083,"Loud Noises : I feel like for the first 22 years of my life I was sitting in the back seat of a car that I had set to autopilot. Someone times my car ran out of fuel and I felt stranded and I had people around me offer rides. Those were probably the best times of my life. Sitting shotgun in someone else's car while they drove was so nice, but I feel like while I was in other people's cars there was so much noise that no one could hear me. So, I stopped trying to listen. I stopped trying. Its hard to hear through the noise of life but occasionally I hear brief calls from whoever's car I am in at the time. Those noises are scary because they are unfamiliar. Often when I hear one of those noises, I'd jump out of the car that I was in. I think I have been jumping out of other people's cars so often I don't even know where my own car is anymore. Now when people ask me to get into their cars, I can barely hear them anymore. The noises of life have gotten too much. All I want is to get into someone's car and have them take me to mine. But I don't even know how to make my own voice heard anymore. Now, whenever someone stops to let me in and ask me where I am going, the only way I know how to have my voice be heard is to shout over the noises of life. And when I shout at someone trying to help me, they drive away. Or maybe I run away. Why are the noises so loud?",2

2090,"What books would you recommend for a depressed person in his/her early 20's? : Hey redditors, I really need help so I'd appreciate if you would read my post and maybe change my life to help me see the light again. I have seen a lot of posts and advices on good books but I'd like to read a few books more specific for a guy my age, books to change my perspective on life and to feel happy again. Just a little background: I'm a 22 year old guy who has suffered a lot lately. I had a decent relationship with a girl who is perfect in everyones eyes: Loving, loyal, beautiful, smart, studying &amp; working hard to guarantee ourselves a bright future. The problem was that she was literally too good and respectful for me and I didn't love her enough for some reasons. I'm still trying to figure those reasons. We decided to break up because I didn't see her as the mother of my children. I cheated on her twice (kissing a different girl) and I know I would never do that when I was together with someone I love truly. Not trying to justify the cheating, because I know that's completely wrong and we both suffered from it. After the second time I knew I didn't love her enough. Anyways, we broke up half a year ago and since then everything has going downhill for me. I did good in school, had a good life and was happy until then. After her, I was in pain because I knew I would never have someone like het ever again, but once again, I just didn't see a future with her even though she is perfect in any way possible. I just need someone who is less polite and who wouldn't be afraid to have a discussion with me when I'm wrong. I know that seems really weird to hear, but it is what it is. I became an addict, used to do XTC once a year at a festival but in september I bought a lot at once, just to feel happiness again. I discovered cocaine and ketamine and became addicted. I am doing way less now than before but still too much. I used to take pills in bed just to feel happy during the night. Sometimes 6 pieces a night. Been to the doctor and a psychologist and they are now helping me to do less and eventually never again. My parents know nothing about me doing drugs and I want to keep it that way, my friends do know though and they are concerned. The relationship with my mother has been unstable for a few years. It is better now but we still fight a lot, also because she is really depressed and that is hard to deal with. The relationship with my dad is perfect though. They're both single. Relationship with my siblings (kids of my mom, different dad) is pretty good too. I used to text a different girl but when I fell in love she stopped responding and that's why I have been feeling bad for the past few days.I have good days, but sometimes, like today, I feel useless. I hate thinking about having to work whole my life to then spend your money when you're - in my opinion - too old. (here you can reture when you are 67, probably 70 when it's my time to retire.) I just have a feeling that this life is not for me and I want to know the meaning of life. In my eyes we live to work and then die, if that's what life is, I don't want to live that life. But no, I would never commit suicide if that's what you're thinking.But I know there is way more than that, I just have a wrong perception of life and I want it to change. I've been watching a lot of motivational speakers lately and I've read a lot about books changing the life of many people. (The subtle art of not giving a f*ck, meditations,...). It really has an impact on me and I know there are reasons to live and ways to be happy.I really want to feel happy again, find reasons to live this life and just be positive in life, having the ability to control (and maybe even turn off) my emotions in stead of letting them take control over me. If you read until here, I am very thankful, you are a good person for willing to help someone in need. Now, what books do you people recommend to find the meaning of life, to be positive again, to gain control over your emotions and just to be happy again. I am desperate for good books and I know they will help me become a positive person. Any recommendation is fine, I just want to feel happy again, forever. Thank you very much for reading &amp; have a good day :)",2

2094,"My life has been a consistent downward slope. : When I was young I remember feeling genuinely happy a lot. I've slowly slid downhill from there, I managed to move uphill precisely once in my life. I tricked a girl into loving me for three years, until she finally wise up and told me to get lost. I lost my friend group from high school, and haven't managed to keep a friend for over a year since then. I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a very likable person, and that knowledge, plus my loneliness cause me to become more bitter, and less likable which perpetuates the cycle. I just feel like I was never really meant to exist, like life has slots for gears, and I'm just a disc, so I could never get any traction. I guess it makes sense? With the billions of people that live on this Earth, statistically it makes sense that at least some of them would be born without the necessary attributes to be a functional human.",2
2095,Wanted to feel pain : So this past Saturday I went out for a friends birthday. I know I shouldn't mix alcohol with my antidepressants but I was feeling really down earlier that day. Mostly nervous about having to be around friends and have them talk to me like I'm a child that needs comforting (almost all my friends know how I attempted a year and a half ago) long story short....By the end of the night I had a lot to drink and was feeling really anxious and mad at the same time. So I decided to pick a fight with a random guy. In my head I purposely wanted to loose and get my ass beat. I wanted to feel pain. Now I'm feeling the effects of the concussion I think I have. Last thing I remembered was my face getting slammed on the payment. If you guys could see my face right now you'd probably wonder why I wanted this to happen. I don't trust myself going out anymore. I feel like I'll keep doing this. Is my mind too chicken shit to attempt to take my life again and instead wants to leave it to someone else to do it for me?,2
2096,"I sensed my subconscious yesterday. : I was listening to a Tricky song, Hot Like A Sauna, and *immediately* broke out into tears. Took me a second but I was able to connect it to my ex - that was ""our"" album. I guess it still hurts.I decided to switch to a song that had nothing to do with her. That ended up being Cradle Of Filth - From the Cradle to Enslave. Now, when I started the song on Spotify, I ...felt/sensed/noticed this... gods, how do I say this... it was like an external set of ...eyes, looking down into my mind/memories/past and trying to connect the song to something related to my ex.It felt like a web-crawler. An automated computer program that was 100%, completely and totally untouchable in *any* way conceivable. I could not ""see"" it, I could not talk to it, I could not rationalize it. It was something that felt alien but had to be me. It was going through **rapid fire** ...I hesitate to call them memories but it was like that - images, scenes, memories - but they happened SO fast that I have no memory of them at all. I was able to sense them in a way and that's how I knew they were all tangental to my ex in a weird way.I am 100% convinced I somehow witnessed my own subconcsious at work trying to either defend or punish me. When I think about it all rationality kinda leaves the scene. There is no sense to be made of it. I could *feel* it working.Not sure if it was related to my depression or not, but it has never happened before.",2

Theres a prep test for all in my grade that i didnt know about until friday, but my mom expected me to know before hand, and that i need to tell the school how to inform students and parents. I have work in my drawing class to do, but i am unmotivated. I dont care enough about it, and being sat with the paper i just push it aside. Too many things are like this. I should enjoy drawing like i always did, but i just dont care. My english teacher treats my class like its AP (it is not) and i cant keep up. Now i expect that i wont understand or be able to keep up so i dont care. I dont try. I dont know what to do about it anymore. I feel like such a failure to my family and teachers. I dont want to tell her that she needs to teach easier things, or that i need help again or that i need more time for a project that i slept through class work time again as with every other god damn thing. I cant handle it. I wish i didnt get so much pressure put on me for school and for things about my education that i cant control but am expected to- like how the school informs parents and students. I want it all to fuck off. I cant take it.  Any advice on skipping? Ha",2

I feel dumb, unappreciated, useless, and depressed as a result. It's taken 33 years but I think I finally have to just stay quiet and not attempt to help people anymore. That's sad in itself.

2110,"Incredibly alone : Apologize first for any grammatical or punctuation errors. And alot of this is going to come of as rambling.A little bit about myself. I'm 29 years old male and recently had to find a place with some roomates. They're busy alot so they cant really hangout. I work at a crappy dead end job and dont have any ambition to find another, plus if I quit I would most likely lose the outlet I have to talk to the few people I do and without that I dont know what I would do. I am alone and have been most of my life. I've  always struggled to make friends and was bullied alot as a kid. I assumed that's how people treated you so I got used to it. I've never been on a date or had a girlfriend. I don't know what it is about me that people find off putting. I try to be a good listener. I am overweight but I take care of myself. I make sure my hair is fixed my clothes are neat and clean and that I always smell nice. I make an effort to appear presentable. Outwardly I dont think people would know how lonely I am and how everyday I feel like a failure in everything I do. I try to be a good person and make time for people.  I'm friendly and try to be helpful and show people I care but all I get is rejection. I have maybe one friend but hes busy alot and dealing with his own stuff and I don't want to push him away by being needy. I don't think most people are bad or have bad will towards other people. I used to think people were terrible but as I've matured I've found it's not always black and white. I think people can be jerks and self centered sometimes but I think for the most part most people are okay.  So I havent given up on people yet. It just feels like nobody wants me. I think people like me well enough just not enough to be my friend or something more. I've always had terrible luck with woman. I'm good at talking to them and listening but I can't ever seem to move past that into something romantic. I don't blame them because sometimes I take a step back from myself and I think who would want this.  I've been told I am a nice guy I just wish I had someone I could show. I am so tired of being alone. I  didnt ask to be alone. I dont want to be alone and I tried to make friends and seek romance but all I get is rejection.  The only think keeping me going is the hope that tomorrow will be better but everyday that gets harder and harder to believe.  I feel like I must have some major flaw that I can't see and I just wish someone would tell me what it is so I could fix it. Again I apologize for the rambling. I'm just in a really bad place right now. I just wan someone to talk to.",2
2111,"I dunno wtf to title this lol : I'm really not good right now. I feel like I'm only staying alive so that I don't annoy other people or make their life inconvenient by me dying. I just feel so trapped and like what's the point ya know. Like I don't even stay alive for me anymore, but what I truly want is to be dead. And I don't know how to change that desire. I already feel like an inconvenience and killing myself would only prove that. Why is it that the people who come back from their depression and do meaningful things with their lives are seen as the heroes. What about the people who never find their way out. Maybe they're just being true to themselves by committing suicide, maybe it's okay for them to leave, because that's what they truly desire and they have been living in hell on earth. And maybe it takes bravery to end their life with all the pressure from everyone else to just keep going. I'm sick of just staying here for everyone else, can I just do something for me once? Something that I actually want? If people truly loved me wouldn't they want my suffering to end, whatever the cost, even if it inconvenienced them? I dunno. I just don't fucking care anymore. I feel like Logan in his last movie.

I wanted to cut myself because the emotional pain is too much that I wish it was physical pain. I haven't been sleeping well ever since the night I found out, I lost my appetite even more, and I've been cold. There's so many things popping out of my mind like what did I do wrong to deserve this? Why the hell did he do this me? Am I even worth it? Am I just some sort of play thing that you get to toy with then just throw away? I wanted answers to my questions and my mind just won't shut up. I couldn't even see myself smiling or laughing anymore. I don't even want to go outside; I just lock myself in my room and stay in bed all day.

She is super super talented at what she does and she has pretty much dedicated her whole life to perfecting her art skills since she was in grade school. She practices everyday, does freelance artwork, and has even attended an art college. She has recently made accounts on every social media app known to man in order to promote her art and makes sure to post consistently as possible. Therefore, I am sure she would have a MAJOR MAJOR mental breakdown if God himself came down and told her the following: âSorry but you're graphic novels are never gonna get published and you're not be a game designer. Hell, you'll be lucky if any of your social media accounts get more than 500 followers.â?I know that make her feel as if her heart would rip out of her chest and it would crush every part of her soul.That is exactly how important my dream of finding love is to me and as I get older.....I feel like that dream is slipping more and more away from me.

2117,"I don't like who I'm becoming : So just a bit of context.So I'm a third year university student and last December I had to have surgery on my lower back. It was a pretty big surgery so I missed around 1 month of school to recover. But during those weeks I was alone pretty much everyday and stuck in bed all day because I couldn't move properly. The best part of my day was seeing the nurses and doctors for post surgery care because I could finally talk to someone, someone who cared. It was the most loneliest time in my life because most of my friends were busy with finals and I was just alone with my thoughts. So I started over analyzing a lot of things and hate myself for missing classes and finals. I know that what happen was out of my control but I keep feeling like this was punishment for something I did. When I came back to school for the next semester I realized a lot of people didn't even realize that I missed a month of school. And these are people that I've know for two years, we all know each other in my program because there's only 60 of us. I feel like if people don't notice that I'm gone for a month, they never really cared about me at all. My friends told me that everyone was just busy with finals so no one was really paying attention to anything but themselves. But I still feel like no one cares about me and I dealing with everything on my own. After that I started to notice that I genuinely hate everyone. I hate seeing other people laughing and smiling with other people. I deserve to be happy too. I stopped talking to a lot of my friends because I realized that they only ever talked to me if they needed anything. I tried talking to one of my friends about my whole situation and she said I was just being dramatic. I stopped talking to her about myself after that.But now I'm starting to realize that I'm changing. I will spend the entire day without saying a word or talk to anyone. I hate seeing other people be happy. I want them to be in the same situation as me. I keep looking at people and hoping something bad happens to them. I never thought like before. I started drinking before I go to bed because I can't sleep anymore. I used to love my program and going to school. But now when ever I hate even entering the building and see people in my program. I stopped caring about things. I don't care about school, or my life or about me. I have no motivation at all do anything. I used to have my life together and now everything is a mess.I don't like who I am right know. I really want to go back to who I was. But I don't know what I'm supposed to do.Sorry for the long rant",2

2136,"What should I do if I fail most of my classes for two semesters in college, kill yourself or look into something else? : I don't want to look into something else because socially, the trades are really looked down upon and if I stay in school, my gpa will be total dog shit due to the fact that I failed two semesters even if I redid the classes. I don't know what to do unless suicide is the only option in this case? I know I have a job as a delivery driver for pizza anyways, but I don't want to live that life because I want to look back and say I started from here, and I have a great life now when I'm in my later years. I want to feel like I did something, but I find it insanely hard to focus with all the social media stuff, hanging with friends, etc. I don't want to live an unfulfilling life because that would hurt more than living a life where it's stressful as fuck, but I could look around at all the stuff I got and share it with people.

2137,"An introverted college student's ramblings and cry for help : (This is my first time ever posting in reddit, so I apologize in advice for any weirdness. This may come off as more of a rant if I'm not careful.)I've started college recently and its nothing like I expected it to be, I've only been here for less than two semesters and I feel absolutely alienated here. I have no friends still and I feel like such a stranger and that I don't belong here. Now I've always been an extreme introvert, the majority of my social interactions coming from games such as World of Warcraft. Recently I had quit WoW due to my failing grades (which I will get to) and now I feel like my only lifeline to people has been cut off. It's not that I don't like people, I just have no idea how to approach them. This compounded with my miserable GPA of my first semester has put me into a huge rut of depression that is actually scary. I genuinely feel nauseous at times and the loneliness has been having an effect on my psyche. Not to mention my grades slipping due to the simple fact of not having as my dad would put it âfire in my heart.â?I live alone with him and I am genuinely grateful I am able to depend on him, but I don't want to worry him about these feelings of depression and like a layer of weight is always on me. The thing is, I used to have that fire, and now I feel so empty without any passion. To put it simply, I feel hopeless, I used to be the master of studying and school. I was almost valedictorian and passed my classes with ease, including honors classes. Now, I feel like an absolute idiot, I can't absorb anything I study, and I feel low all the time now. It's begun to affect my dad and my dog, I've stopped going on walks with my dog, and my dad keeps asking me if I'm okay. And to be honest, I don't know if I am.Now I haven't thought of anything drastic, like harming myself, but I do just wish I could sleep all day and desire so much to regain my social outlet of WoW again. But I know that won't help, I'm honestly at loss at what I should do and any advice would be appreciated, whether it be college or social related, or even just what I could possibly do to regain my excitement for life I used to have or whatever, I'm at a loss for what I even need or want right now.(Once again, I apologize if this post seems abnormal, I'm new to posting and honestly have no idea what I'm doing, I do hope you understand)",2

2153,"I may have been abused and I'm so angry : My father may have abused me. I guess it was abuse, im not sure. I just have intense memories. These images in my head that i can't get rid of. Thing is, im pretty sure I was a difficult kid. I would get into fights with him a lot of times. Like once when i was really young i threw a rock at my sister and made her bleed. He yelled at me for a while and kept pushing me against the wall and knocking me down. ""You could have killed her!"" He said that. I still remember it.Now i hardly ever get in fights with him. I just fight with my mom now.Another time when i was maybe 14 my brother was annoying me and as i poured syrup on my waffles i told him, ""did you know you have to stab somebody a lot of times for them to die? People think its only once but its actually a lot."" Something like that. My dad was in the room.The next thing i knew he whisked me away to the garage.I was there for over an hour. He yelled at me a bunch of times and threatened to have me comitted to an institution. We had a bunch of bikes in the garage that he kept pushing me against. I kept knocking them over. At one point he grabbed me around the neck and said, ""I'll kill you,"" through gritted teeth. He was mad, I think because he thought I'd actually try to stab my brother. He kept threatening me, saying what hed do to me if I tried to do anything to ""his family.""So as you can see i was a difficult kid. I did/said things that were fucked up sometimes. I feel like, in a way, i deserved what happened to me in the garage. Though the fact that it still haunts me at age 20 makes me think it might have been a not quite normal reaction on his part.I have other memories: once he sat on my head on the sidewalk once. Or another time when he called me a goddamn dumbass, or when he called me a pussy. Or all those times he used to lock me outside.Mostly i just remember how his face looned when he'd get like that: his pipils tiny, his mouth bared into a growl. His veins kinda popping out, his hair askew. Its a very familiar image to me. Thing is this post makes him seem like some kind of monster though, and hes really not. Sometimes he seems like a sad old man to me. Other times he seems like a banal asshole, hardly worth my time. And i no he got hit a lot when he was a kid, way worse than i ever was. He always told me how lenient he was with me compared to how his father would have been. His grandfather was even worse. Apparently once his grandfather didnt like how his father reached across the table during dinner, so he stabbed his hand with a fork. So in a way, im lucky.But other times i am so angry. I think about killing him. Ever since I was a kid i have fantasized about killing him, or at least breaking his shins with a hammer. Sometimes i get so angry that I wish I could kill everyone. Or better yet, myself. I dont know. I just wish I could make this all go away. And im still financially dependent on him. And i probably will be for much longer. I cant even talk about it in real life. Its like it never even happened. All i have is venting to this stupid fucking website.",2

2158,"I am a joke : My entire life didn't go the way it was supposed to go. I will be 27 this year and I have no higher-level education, no driving license, still living with my mom and being financially dependant on her, my only job experience is when I worked 2 years as a janitor and I had sex one time in the span of 5 years. It would be 7 years but I went to a hooker when I was 22.At the age of 13 when hitting puberty, I got a nasty blackhead rush in my penis due to poor hygiene and it's still there, after nearly 14 years I haven't dealt with that problem. I have a fungus infection on my chest and pubic area and I have slight gynecomastia so I look like I have manboobs even tho I am skinny. I had to shave my head because I am not even 27 yet but already balding and can't really have any proper haircut. My parents divorced when I was 11 and they both moved out so I was growing up with abusive grandparents that were treating me like a free physical laborer to do the job around the house and their garden. I can't connect emotionally with people because I don't know how to and because of that my longest relationship was merely 10 months long - because it was a long-distance relationship, normal ones don't last longer than 3 or 4 months.My entire life is a chain of unfortunate events. I feel like a test subject selected by some crazy scientist to see how much one human can take and not kill himself. I am so tired of pretending everything is fine and trying to live my life, I just feel like I no longer can do that.At the age of 24, I started a 1-year long course that prepared me for university. I applied and got accepted to uni at the age of 25 and currently, I am doing the 2nd semester of 2nd year. I went to a doctor and got some cream for the fungal infection and blackheads, but it's been 6 weeks of applying these and there is no visible effect yet.A girl from my class that's only 19 years old was interested in me and I felt happy the first time for a very long time, but all it took was to have sex with me once. I was unable to make give her orgasm and who knows if she noticed my blackheads, probably yes. Afterward, she cut the contact and we are not speaking anymore. Now she is dating another guy from our class and I have to watch them being intimate and happy together every day during classes.I tried to be more social and engaging with people, but I just don't click with anyone. I don't have social life and every time I try it just feels like I am invading or overstepping. I am just that weird stranger who sometimes has a small-talk with you. I have no one to talk to, I have no close friends and I feel like it's time to just end it all.My life always was a miserable mess filled with sadness and disappointment, that's why I am thinking more and more intensely about ending it. What's the point? I remember when I was 20 and I was thinking that one time it will get better, ""Just wait and see how your life will look at the age of 25, you will probably have family on your own by then!"". Well, no. It's been only worse and worse and it feels like I will not finish university because of my declining mental state. I am falling behind with material and can no longer follow what's happening in the lectures due to a lack in knowledge from previous lectures.I am a joke.",2

You spoke to me as if I was human and showed me empathy.

Of course you had your flaws, don't we all, but i adored you despite them.You were always so intelligent and bright but stubborn and short tempered. I know at times you do not feel loved but do you really need a lover to realize just how loved you are? Just how special you are? You are incredible in so many ways.What makes you special? Your big and loving heart. Its not easy to see past the cover of a book to see its real beauty..but you..you do that better than anyone I know.I know life is hard and you're fighting a hidden war but you always were a fighter- a warrior.

2165,"How do I forget : So a little about my story. I was engaged to this woman, I'll call her KR. She was married then divorced after we got together. We were engaged to be wed after 2 years of a relationship, 4 months after engagement. She was very abusive physical and mental but She was the only thing ever on my mind. Idk why I ever let it go as far as it did. Maybe it was just love... or so I though it was. Day in and out..  long nights of work (railroad is a unforgiving career). She was the person I could open up to about anything, who I though was my best friend. We shared the good times, the bad, the sick and the sad together.  We were both introverts so we basically had each other then friends at work. We were not the big party type more of the party of 2 type so she was basically all I had, so you could say she was my best friend, as everyone who wants that bliss of a relationship. One night we were drinking together, having a great time playing games together and just having a great time when we started a serious conversation about our future...  this is where things go down hill and fast. We got to talking about what we would want and things we could see us doing in the future. I go on saying how I'd like to own a 1968 Dodge Charger and to be happily married and she went on too day she wanted to own a 70 Dodge Dart  and to finally have a successful marriage. We get to drinking some more and she lets it slip...  that she had cheated on me twice in the first 3 weeks of our relationship...  once with her ex husband and once again with a random hook up she had while in Vegas for some sort of convention she had for her current place of work. I stop dead in my tracks of doing anything... feeling my chest tighten up..  I was tired of how she would hit me or do horrible abusive things to me. I had got up and just walked out of the house and went to a friends house. Didn't want to speak to KR or even see her... I mean for fucks sake if someone moves too fast in my general direction I flinch now I had noIdea why would of happens if I had said something. I was raised to never lay a hand on a woman so I was defenseless...  I call off the next day of work and just call her and tell her I want all of her stuff out of the home I own. We get into a big argument, her saying oh it was so far in the past I should just forget about it. It's done and over now why ruin something we have now.  âWhat a relationship built on lies?â?I say to KR. I went through her fight for her kids, fight to keep her own stuff. Through thick and thin for that woman for her to say she cheated on me in the start...  after the big ending/fight we had she tells me I'm this and that and less of a man for leaving someone over something so little... yea. To her it was little...  But to the now..  I'm sitting here depressed as all hell. Drinking my sorrows and sadness away every night thinking toMy self, did I do the right thing...   still as it is 4 months later I ask my self should I of stayed with her...  I'm so lonely now and I don't know what to do with my self on a daily basis. The tattoos and drinking only do so much for me..  lately it's been getting through all the pain I put my self through. I feel just so alone and like I will never find anyone else. I want to look her up and tell her I'm sorry everyday but I can't come to my senses to do it cause I know I'm not in the wrong here yet I feel sorry..  I don't know what to do anymore beside drink my self to sleep every morning and maybe one of these dating sight will come through that I find the right one but it just does not feel like any of them actually work (beside matching with a damn bot). I don't know what to doAnymore...  any advise is really appreciated cause I'm at the point where I'm Just tired of trying...  tired of pushing forward in life...

As I'm hitting another episode of deep, spiraling depression right now, I find myself empowered by my own words. I hope some of you find this letter helpful as well.My mentality, for my entire life I feel like, has been plagued by me victimizing myself. I blow small situations out of proportion, I get in the way of what I want (many examples throughout my relationship with who I believe is the best boyfriend I've ever had), and I give my power of happiness to other people. I expect a certain level of comfort to be provided to me, and when it is not delivered, I become miserable, blaming others for treating me this way, or the universe for the way I am, for making me as traumatized of an individual as I am.I need to stop.Everything I've done, everything that has happened to me, is for me to take responsibility for. I need to stop being selfish and care about feeling good, or having someone else make me feel better. They're not responsible for my happiness, my success, or my suffering. I am. I am not powerless. I decide what I want. And no one else need to get me or understand me for me to be happy. I do not need to please other people. I will do what I want to do, and say what I really want, instead of feeling powerless and continue to suffer. I also do not need make other people feel bad for the things I did to myself. I should ask for their intention, and respond by listening with intent. The perspective of my victim identity only adds to my suffering, and amplify the situation even more than what it is. I should not find fault with others, because that is why I end up dwelling on faults I find in myself. This victim mentality is not permanent, and it is not something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. This is something I can change, and the first step to it is recognizing that I have been acting like a victim. I am not powerless in this change, and I will remove that victim identity for myself.",2

2174,"I'm tired of being afraid and feeling empty : So some perspective: I was in a relationship with this girl for close to five years, and for awhile everything was great. However that last year she was really mad because I couldn't get a higher paying job and it was terrifying to really think about moving in and being a financial burden. Near the end she really started to resent me and everything came crashing down.Directly or not it's made me feel really worthless and like I'm not even worth helping or improving. I've just been so afraid to move forward with my life and it's so tough. It's been over a year and I still can't stop thinking about if I just tried harder or believed in myself we could have made it work. Even the thought of trying to improve sends me into an anxious spiral. If it's not that I just feel like a husk going through a routine.

2176,"OCD and Depression : I have OCD and not depression (at least that's what I tell myself), though I guess the two are not mutually exclusive.   It's isolating sometimes, I think that is where the sadness comes from.  Seeing friends is hard when there are nonsensical reasons that you can't go out after work.  Having hobbies can be hard when you can't get out of the bathroom.  Sleep is hard when the times you need to be in bed and out of bed don't allow for it.  Every time I get into a new hobby I am always worried, waiting for the moment I am going to have to leave it behind for some silly reason.  I get scared about my intrusive thoughts, when they fixate on things like jumping off a building or walking in front of a car. I don't want to do those things but I am forced to fixate on them, looping the thoughts over and over. It is desensitising.Weirdly, the rest of my life is doing fine, my job is great and only getting better. Embracing my OCD helped me get where I needed to be. My partner is amazing and more than I could ever ask for. But I am petrified of the thoughts taking over and I lose myself to an off intrusion and end it all. I get angry at all my long term friends for being able to keep so close to one another while I sit in the shower again at home and dont talk to them for another two months. The worst part is I know the envy is silly.  Compulsions are lonely and I am sick of them.",2

I gasped and he apologized but I just laughed it off. I just could not believe someone would be so blunt with me. I didn't even think I looked THAT bad!!

2187,"What is your favorite and least favorite part of the day? : Mornings are probably the worst part of the day for me, it's the time of the day when reality hits you and you feel a heaviness in your chest vowing to 'never leave the bed'. Of course you have to get out of bed, luckily for me I don't work so I have the time to eventually get up because I slowly start to feel better and being on the phone helps. Usually takes 1-2 hours.Daytime goes by very quickly, lunch starts too quickly, never hungry and food tastes like dust so I have to force myself to eat, daytime is basically an attempt to outrun time and forcing yourself to look after yourself while all you want to do is stay in bed and play computer games or stare blankly into space. Daytimes are better than mornings though. Night-time is ok, the day is ending already but for night ours this is the time when our minds work the best and for some it's the only time when I feel functional so I stay up until after midnight because I don't want that feeling of being 'functional' to end. Don't want the morning to come back but eventually it will so we will have to submit to the impending morning. Night-times are my favourite time of the day though. Plus, going to sleep is nice in a way that it's kinda like letting go of the pressures of life, feel happier in my dreams as well, it's kinda nice and I suppose that makes it harder to stay awake in the mornings.",2

I did everything that I was told I should, I learnt a trade whilst getting a degree (I'm the only person I know who has one). Yet through no fucking fault of my own I'm sat here alone as fuckin usual getting rejected from minimum wage jobs because I am either too qualified or in-experienced. I grew up in one of the worst areas in the UK(and have not long ago had to move back to my mums due to disability), all my friends have an addiction to either coke, weed or beer (Like every single fuckin one of them). Avoiding them is making me more depressed as I feel like a social outcast. Even if it wasn't for the drugs I dont wanna hang around with these complete utter tools. Most of them are racist af (I'm mixed race but one of the ""good ones""). One guy legit scoffed and went off on a homophobic rant all because I was listening to Craig David (true story). And another dude who legit cant even spell is still watching Alex Jones videos in 2020.Honestly guys, I cant fuckin cope anymore.

2201,"Today marks our 2 year anniversary, and 4 month and 5 day break-up. This lost love is showing me how doomed I am in life. : I'm the guy that keeps posting about lost love. I spent today at the cafe she and I went to 2 years ago. I was hoping she would come by, I was hoping she'd just want to have a peek at where I took her for the first time and for our first anniversary as a surprise. I visited where we met up as well, I was hoping she'd come. I guess no matter what, when I say I will unconditionally love, I meant it.... she didn't mean it. Today has been one of the hardest days of my life. While I am struggling here, she's probably having the time of her life somewhere else. After all, she did leave me knowingly and when I needed her. I don't know why I can't stop thinking of her. Every god damn day I think of her and its just etched into my mind with no sign of slowing down.  She did hurt me, and she hurt me real good. But I can't stop blaming myself for being a failure... her brother said so as well. I am a failure, I just mature slowly. I barely got to experience a teenage life, no rebelliousness, always doing what I am told. I see my friends buying houses and getting married.... I barely have 20K to my name. Even that is from saving and saving and saving. I struggle so much finding work, no matter where I go I get rejected... Either I am too qualified or not qualified enough. I'm just so demotivated from doing this shit over and over again to no avail. I am also enough of an asshole that I keep blaming my parents for being so restrictive in my life, not letting me do anything I want freely. The one topic I rebelled against them was for my gf. I would fight them so much and hurt them so much, but I loved her and our dated culture shouldn't stand in the way. They did accept her after about 4 months, it took so long that she just wasn't as interested or grateful anymore. She knew from day 1 it won't be easy, and even when I was telling them, she told me to fight for her. The second I left to go study overseas, she asked for space, asked for distance, then left me. I can blame her for being selfish, for using me when its convenient but throwing me out when it wasn't... But I can't entirely blame her because I am a failure. I can't land a job in my current qualification, I gave up studying medicine because I was driven into severe depression after she broke up with me, and I can't give her what she wanted when she wanted it... Every fucking thing had to be maticulously managed so she isn't hurt and my parents aren't hurt.... Clearly I've done this so poorly to constantly hurt my parents and lose my ex. Now that she's gone, I've become so angry, I have the problem she had..... constantly angry at everything. I used to be a calm and collected person, barely ever got angry.... people would ask if I get angry, even she asked. Now I'm just a ticking timebomb waiting to explode. I am constantly annoyed at my parents, especially my dad. I think this comes from the fact that he was the one who did not want to meet her or include her in our family at first. He was the one who didn't let me drop out of engineering and do something else, he didn't let me look for a part-time job when I was in high school, he always pushed me towards medicine, always put down my ideas of professions that interested me. I wouldn't blame him and his very asian way of thinking, mum was a little better, but still similar in cutting down my profession choices. See? Even now I've started to blame them. They do the best they can with what they know. I'm so tired of myself right now, I just want to die. Honestly, nothing could be better than dying right now. My parents will have my older sister and younger brother, they are way more successful than me anyway. They are kids to be proud of.... me? I'm a loser, a waste of space really. I've hurt others enough. I just want to be a memory or less. I don't care, I'm not worthy, I have let enough people down. I yearn for the day something kills me, because I am too much of a fucking coward to even do that. I stared the path down a bridge a few weeks ago... the height gave me butterflies. I tied a rope around my neck, but I wasn't high enough and it started to become just uncomfortable to try and bare for longer. I need freedom from my own mind.

For my 11th birthday, whatever happened that day, my dad and sister either forgot or didn't care enough to wish me happy birthday. To add insult to injury, it was just me singing with my mom that night while my dad and sister hung out upstairs with their doors closed. I know this might sound very whiny, and this WAS an isolated incident, but the fact that I can still hear my moms âhappy birthday to youâ?and remember the tears streaming down my face afterwards while I ate my slice in my room just serves as a reminder to how heartbreaking this event(no matter how small or insignificant) was to me. Every year from that point on I've cried on every single one of my birthdays. Not just because of this event, but mostly because I'm just always lonely on my birthdays haha.

2207,"Do this when it gets too hard to handle : There's no doubt that when it comes to depression, we sometimes feel like it's too much to handle, we're trying to keep too strong through this that when it becomes too much, we try to end it all because we don't want to stay for the breakdown. Some describe it as being locked up in a dark room with a window to see everyone else be happy, while others say it's like standing between two walls that crush you more and more. So, what do you do when the walls crush you so badly that you feel like you can't breathe, you don't wanna live anymore and death would be more painless than life?Observe. Be aware. Accept. Let go.See, if two mental walls pushed you in the middle for a very long time, we would be so annoyed that we'd then try to push them back because so many people tell us to fight our depression; so, we try to fight it, thus end up breaking our metaphorical arms, feeling desperate because we've tried everything, and when you fight too much and try to resist too much, you feel like you've been defeated. I say: **STOP FIGHTING.**All you have to do is be aware of that feeling that comes and goes. Depression will be there most of the time, but sometimes it's not. We can all agree that depression isn't always equally horrible. Sometimes, it gets annoying, it bothers us and we can't focus on our work, and sometimes it gets unliveable and we try to end it all because it bothers us way too much. You have to be AWARE of those feelings, you have to KNOW when they're happening. You have to understand that when shit gets too tough, it's not you being weak, but it's your depression telling you to stop resisting pain. Accept the pain, let it come and go, but you have to do this while being aware of it happening, you have to notice when it happens so that when you think of ending it all, just remember that it's not you.Sometimes we get too lost in depression, we think that depression defines our personality and that without depression we would be losers, hence people think that depression is a good thing. This is a wrong mindset. Without depression, you would feel exactly the same - except the negativity. Everything will become manageable, you will be more focused, more energetic, more everything + less negativity. Your ""asshole"" or ""smart depressed guy"" personality will be there as well, but only if you want it to be there.Depression doesn't last forever, and this is for real. It seems like it's forever, but it's not. You have to be aware when the shit times happen, but you also have to be aware when the good times happen, because even though they don't feel like good times, you have to be aware of them so you could evaluate that they could be worse. Some people struggle too hard to be happy, so when something good happens to them, they feel like they don't deserve it because depression doesn't let happy things make them happy. But they do make you happy to some degree, and be aware of it when it happens, because when you think of ending it all, you have to remember these times when good things happened to you despite the fact that you weren't happy, because you have to realize that there are good things in the world and that depression is like glasses that don't let you see them. These glasses, just like any other glasses, don't last forever, they get blurry, they stop working, so naturally they get off your face.Moral of the story: Awareness is the key, for both the negative and positive situations. When walls push you and you're stuck and can't move, stop resisting, be aware. Always remember that this doesn't last forever, remember this post in your head whenever you think that you're never gonna get rid of it. Truth is, some people can't get rid of it, but depression will leave by itself. Learn to say no to people, learn to give yourself what you want because it helps you to learn self-love because you're giving your mental health some space and freedom. No matter what people you disappoint or make angry, know that you don't have to care about them at the moment. As long as depression is there, you can't help anyone because what happens when you have a flu and try to cure another person who has a flu? Wouldn't that be extremely difficult? Or when being on an airplane and things go wrong, did you know that the passangers have to put on masks on their faces first before they put on their child's face? This is because you can't help anyone if you're fucked as well, so remember what I've just said and survive through this thing. I don't want you to fight it, I want you to let it come and go until it dies.",2

I know that's kind of a shitty way to gauge my relevance, but I think it puts my situation in terms others can understand. It really hurts to realize that instead of being talked about behind your back, you're just merely not being talked about at all.With all this, Reddit's been feeling pretty good the past month.

2236,"Emotional Depression vs Chemical Depression &amp; how the mind reacts : Many of you probably know this but just in case...If you have emotional depression, it's because something bad happened recently.  You lost your job and bills are piling up, your best friend died, you lost a child, whatever.  It's an emotional response to a life event.  Things suck right now, but they can and will get better because of time.  You aren't the first person to be in this situation, you won't be the last person. Hang in there, get what help you can.If you have chemical depression, it's because your body isn't making the right amount of the right chemical, or it's going through the right chemical but too quickly, etc.  This is like having diabetes. It's not caused by an event, it's not a reaction to something which has happened or is likely to happen. It's a medical condition that you need medicine to control.  Yes, some people can achieve help with diet changes, some people can exercise their way out, but in all cases it's still a bio-chemical problem.Talk therapy is not going to fix chemical depression.  Changing jobs is not going to fix chemical depression.  Having kids is not going to fix chemical depression.Now, here's the kicker -- your brain is fucking stupid. It does not control the body, it justifies the body. If you eat a pizza and then later feel sick, your brain decides it was the pizza.  It may be that you have the flu and the pizza has nothing to do with it, but your brain is looking for cause and effect, so until it gets convinced otherwise, you hate pizza.Another example:  You think you're drinking decaf, but your actually drinking an energy drink. You get the jitters.  You much be scared of something.  Something bad must be about to happen because otherwise why would you have the jitters.  OMG! You're psychic! You know something bad is about to happen!  Yeah, no. You're brain is stupid. That's all.Well, the exact same thing is true with chemical depression.  Your bio-chemistry says ""you are depressed!"" so your brain says, ""Oh, it must be because.... um.... I hate my job! Or it's because I don't have a girlfriend! No, no, I know! My friends all hate me!""So, when you're feeling down, ask yourself objectively: am I depressed because something is wrong, or am I depressed because my brain is stupid?If you are feeling depressed and its made worse because there's no good reason for you to be depressed, you likely have chemical depression and should talk to a doctor about getting pills.  You can't talk therapy your way out of chemical depression.",2

I've tried to talk to people and ask others to do stuff like grab lunch, but literally every single time I either get brushed off, ghosted, or given obvious excuses like ""Oh uh well I'm just so busy the next few weeks"". No one ever reaches out to me first and tries to ask me to do stuff, either. If I'm not the one reaching out and asking, then no one ever says anything at all. People say to reach out to others and those that care will come to you, but that literally never works.Either everyone forgets I exist when I'm not in their direct line of sight, or they explicitly go out of their way to avoid me.

2256,"Smart guy with a lot of dumb questions : I've really been struggling to post this, since I've always struggled to show any of my feelings towards everyone I know and even towards myself, but here we finally go.I'm a 22 year-old medical student from Europe, 3.5 years into the studies, everything going well so far, passing all tests without even attending the lectures and starting to study few weeks prior to the test phase. Aside of that everything else has also always been going well for me, safe neighborhood, caring parents, good sportsman, nice friends.But now it is that I just seem to have lost interest in everything I once loved over the past year or so. Maybe in life in general, since I don't see any sense in this life anymore. I know many people feel like this, but somehow they seem to find answers that keep them going. To me there is no answer to this question, that makes at least any sense. Some people want to be remembered, some want to achieve something for themselves, some don't want to think about these questions. I want absolutely nothing. Everything that I thought I wanted over the past few years only made me fun for a short time. Even when I have a good time going out with friends or so, that just vanishes, when I start to ask myself these questions and can't find an appropriate answer. So the best thing I've found to do since this started, is rapidly increase my weed consumption. I've been smoking for quite a few years, but it's gotten a little excessive the last year. I still mind to get my shit done, so I only start after I've finished what I had to do for the day. Then I roll a few fat ones and just try to make my  brain not think about those questions till I fall asleep. I've already thought about this causing all those problems in the first place, so I stopped smoking for 2.5 months last year and it didn't really affect my situation at all. I started again because I think it's just better to not think, than think of questions you can't find an answer to and that stop you from moving on.That worked well for quite a time, but lately the quetions just keep getting more and more and I seem to find less and less answers. Why did I choose to study medicin in the first place? How could I think this would be fun for so long, even though it's just smashing facts in your brain, so that you can't possibly remember them?But what hits me by far the most is this: Who the fuck am I even? I feel like what made me finish school without ever trying to ask these questions, is that my father would always have a talk with me when I got a C or worse. This didn't happen really often, but I remember feeling very bad after that for quite a time. I think that's why I still just keep going without even knowing why, I just couldn't stand disappointing him and my mother. So did I make this decision or was it the way society viewed me and I then thought I had to live up to? How can I go on without knowing this? How do I find the answers?There's a lot more questions I struggle answering, but I don't wanna write too much, I doubt anyone's gonna make it until here anyway.

I have yet to see a therapist (and should begin shopping around, to be honest), and it was easy to put in the back of my mind when coupled with other medical problems I'm trying to sort through (incidentally, if anyone wants to take a stab at my recent post in /r/AskDocs, I certainly wouldn't mind...).I'm mostly posting because I hate how alone these feelings make me feel.I apologize, I don't really have planned out what I am going to write, I just *know* that writing something could be helpful.What I've been feeling the past few months, and honestly what I've probably been feeling for the past 18 months, is an unyielding loneliness. Yes, part of that is because, with my current job, I spend half my time (or more) away from my wife, and see her mostly on weekends. Part of that is because I probably haven't fully come to terms with my Dad's death in 2012. Part of that is because I feel like my life, even at age 31, has no direction.What really prompted me to start talking about it was the physical manifestations from my depression.  I cried for the first time a week or so ago since 2012, for pretty much no reason. I was sitting on my couch, knew I couldn't just ""be alone"", and called up a friend, and just immediately tears started streaming down my face. We didn't even talk about anything consequential, mostly TV and video games, but it was helpful and eye-opening at the same time.I know one of the contributors is from my undiagnosed medical condition (see that AskDocs thread), even though it likely is a symptom of anxiety/stress/depression. I just feel fatigued all the time (though, I have been working out and trying to lose weight). I'm just antsy and anxious all the time. There is a deep sadness that I can't seem to overcome, but it doesn't even really ""feel sad"", if that even makes sense?I try to stay reasonable, and try to remind myself of what I felt like *before* I ever felt this way, and know that this can be temporary. It doesn't always help. I feel just stuck in a rut, a never ending cycle of ups-and-downs with my emotions and no clear path forward.Being alone for most of the week (due to the job) certainly doesn't help. Its a great job, but it made me move from a wonderful city to a rural environment where the average age has to be in the mid-50s. I don't have any friends down here, just aquaintences and work colleagues and the like. As I've gotten older, a good chunk of my friends have moved away from the city and/or started families, which is truly awesome, but means I see less of them.I dunno what more I should/can type. I just kind of spitballed a bunch of my thoughts, and its made me feel a tiny bit better. I'm open to advice and suggestions. This is new to me, in the terms of even acknowledging what I'm feeling. Thanks in advance, folks.",2

2267,"I don't normally remember my dreams but when I do it gets weird. : So I had this dream about a week ago and I still think it is the oddest I have had to date. I can post other dreams if anyone is interested. Now this dream may need a little explaining though. It was about a family of a dad, a grandma, a daughter and a son. (The daughter was the older of the two.)So I don't know where it starts but this traveling attraction arrives and it is like a horror attraction but not, I don't remember too much but there was a lot of hype for it.The family goes to it and the father gets killed by one of the exhibits then becomes apart of the attraction. He then kills the grandma and the son, the daughter escapes and is driven home by her dead father with my brother in the taxi, (only time he was in the dream) the girl says farewell and then realizes she is in an alternate reality where her family is alive still and then as she settles her original father comes back and kills her alternate father while making a really weird noise before he gets killed by like the neighbors I think and that was where I woke up.So yeah, just one of the few weird dreams I remember having simply because it is weird.",2

2270,"Seems to me like people justbgive less and less of a shit about you as you get older : Seems to me like at the start of your life (for most of us anyway), people adore you. As you grow up, all those special milestones and moments that you share with people - turning double digits, sleepovers, christmases, people looking after you when you were sick. Eventually you become an adult, and that's where people really start to stop giving a crap about you. Suddenly you're expected to contribute to this shitty world, and if you don't, or you're âdifferentâ? you're nothing. People leave, you lose those connections you had with people, and you're just...on your own for fuck knows how many years, until you either go peacefully (if you're lucky) or end up old and/or sick and debilitated. I see so many people in my work that either have no quality of life or end up rotting away in nursing homes, and I just think â?what happened to these people? At one point most of these people had parents and families who loved them, now look at them - is that going to be me?*â?I can't pinpoint exactly when the way the world sees you changes, but I feel like as a kid, nobody prepares you for the fact that you don't matter, and eventually nobody will give a crap if you're dead or alive because you're just a speck.",2

I know they're genuinely concerned about me, because they're good people who actually care about those close to them.But the problem is that they shouldn't. They shouldn't care about me. They shouldn't try and help me. Because the person they think they're helping doesn't exist. I don't know how I've managed to trick everyone into thinking I'm a good person. That certainly wasn't my intention. But whoops! Guess I have! And now they all think that I'm smart, funny, and kind, when I'm none of those things. Don't know how, but Â¯\_(ã?_/Â¯It'd be best, not just for them, but for me, if they would stop trying to help me. They shouldn't have to deal with my bullshit because I'm too weak to do it on my own. It makes their day worse, and makes me completely incapable of doing anything on my own. As for me, hey, if they stopped helping me, maybe I'd actually do my own goddamn work for once. Maybe I'll actually become a good person.

2275,I just feel dark today. : I haven't felt this way in a while. Maybe it's because I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe it's because my heart is yearning after someone I know I don't belong with. I just want to lay under my blankets and cry. I dont want to talk to anyone or work or do anything right now. I miss when I lived alone and I could curl up and wallow in self pity until I felt better. Sad music playing on repeat through my headphones. My mom wouldn't give me that privacy.

2278,"My girlfriend (22) is depressed, but she's taking it out on me (M 25) : My girlfriend of two years seems to always be depressed. I try my best to be there for her but I feel like she gets so overwhelmed by everything that she has no patience with me and takes it out on me. At 22 she goes through a lot. She's currently working on her masters degree, while also having to take care of her nieces and nephews (5 in total) from like 7 am to 6 pm every weekday until their parents come to pick them up and making sure the house is spotless before her parents come or else they yell at her. She's struggling very hard to make and keep friends. The friends she wants to have (the ones of about 5-6 years) are ghosting her for no reason and want nothing to do with her even though she's done nothing wrong to them. There are two people she talks to now that she knows from school, but it feels like she doesn't want to try with them in fear of getting ghosted and pushed away again. She feels like everyone is constantly mad at her and it persuades the actions she takes. The other day she felt like her family would be mad at her for buying a hydro flask, even though it was with her money and her sister even found it for her on Facebook Marketplace. With this I do feel like her patience is very thin. I do get on her nerves sometimes I will admit, but I personally feel like the way she reacts when I do something so small and unintentional, is too much.For example, two nights ago I was at her house. She has a Brita water container that I used to fill my bottle with, so as a courtesy I wanted to fill up the container again. She was thankful and helped me hold the container while I put water in it with her retractable water faucet. I filled up the container and took the faucet out, but in the process I accidentally wet her pants a little bit. I thought she would just say something like âYou got me wet! Can you hand me a towel?â? but instead I got âWhat the hell dude?? Why would you wet me like that??â?And I told her âI'm sorry, it was an accident, I didn't mean toâ? but she continued being aggressive about it, which got me frustrated because I kept apologizing. I got her a towel and dried her off and said sorry again. I personally don't think I should have been met with this aggression. This went on for about an hour, with the argument getting worse to the point where I wanted to storm out of her house.My girlfriend is extremely insecure and I try my hardest to reassure her, but sometimes it's difficult because she doesn't believe the things I say. Last night I took her to class, but before that I wanted to do something with her (sexual wise), so I went down on her and kept telling her that she is beautiful (she has newly formed stretch marks and it's really effecting her). I made sure to let her know that I'm attracted to her, but then later that night she texted me and basically said she doesn't want to talk to me and how could I do something so horrible. I was really confused. She explained to me that I had liked a picture with a girl showing her âskinny stomachâ?and she kept saying âgo date a skinny girl thenâ? I was extremely confused because I don't really like pictures like that, especially knowing my girlfriends insecurity. So I asked her if she could at least tell me what social media it was on so I can check my likes (which I did and found NOTHING). She basically told me âwhy does it matter, you still did itâ? And then she told me goodnight. But me still confused I tried calling her multiple times, with her rejecting the call, and then I texted her saying âwell you saw the picture, can you screenshot it to me so I know what you're talking about?â?She finally did after ignoring me, and it was a picture of a youtubers wife posting a picture of her being proud of her body since she had been working out a lot. And I finally understood her. What I don't understand is that I liked that picture two years ago (July 30th, 2018) when her and I were six months together. How she found that I liked it was super confusing to me. But she basically asked me not to like pictures line that anymore, and I explained to her that I already don't. Which she got frustrated about because she just wanted me to tell her that. I don't know if it's something I'm doing? But I personally feel like what I'm doing isn't that bad to get such an aggressive response from. I admit I get angry and mean, but only if she jumps out of the gate being aggressive. I'll match her tone and then she'll get mad at me for having a tone. I explain to her âby you telling me I have a tone is giving me a tone.â?because I know when I talk to her I try to talk very calmly.What the hell can I do. I want to be with her and she's an amazing person, but once she gets angry she's mean, aggressive, and will push everyone away (but still expect them to come to her even if she started it)",2

I told myself during my time off, I was going to clean my room. I didn't. During that time, I pretty much just stayed in my bed and slept all day, as much as I could. It was so hard to get out of bed. I did work out a few times but as soon as I got to the gym I felt too exhausted to really do much. I recently went back to work last week and it was...rough. I only work 3 days a week (12 hr. shifts) but it's so fucking exhausting socializing with people for that long and having to pretend to be happy and upbeat. Everyone was really nice and happy to see me but I still felt so depressed. I just wanted to leave and be alone. I'm still not at a point where I want to socialize with people outside of work, but I wanted to force myself to do stuff. I told myself yesterday I was going to start the week off right and clean. I didn't. BUT today, I managed to clean! My room has been a mess for...shit, a long time now.

Two really though months later I forgot about her and found a new girl that I fell in love with. I texted her and she noticed my messages. She replied to me and we started chatting. We dated each other for about two months and I was the happiest person ever, but then I caught her cheating on me with another dude from my school.

2342,"For all you students, many colleges/universities have services and programs for students with disabilities. This includes students with mental and psychological disabilities, like depression. : I just wanted to put it out there, since I think many college students with depression and other mental disorder are unaware of the services they are eligible for. These services are incredibly helpful. In my case, I remember finally applying after finding out about these services (I found out too late unfortunately but oh well), and I was able to get extensions for schoolwork deadlines, extended/extra time during exams, and even class notes from a proctor who would take notes for me instead. All incredibly helpful! Now, every institution is different, perhaps not all schools have these services (that would really suck), and the perks/services you get may depend on you institution, but it's worth finding out. After all we pay so much for tuition, might as well take advantage for what we pay. And of course, many schools have counseling/therapy services as well. Hope someone finds this helpful!",2

I just realized this a month or so ago, and I haven't felt safe in any relationship ever since. I question if my relationships are false, or if they just keep me for attention. I'm just ugly, miserable, definitely not a positive influence in any way, and have the most awkward, disgusting personality ever. I'm completely inexperienced with girls, guys, and everyone.

I tried therapy and several meds with no success, I had the worst episode of depression the last year and changed my meds again, I found some relief but every time I though about me and my mental illnesses I saw myself weak and defeated. But today, ooh today... I feel like I won this endless battle and even though I know that I still need to work a lot on my mental health I feel like I can do it and I don't care if I'm 1.5 years late, I don't care if everything I make in life will take me longer than usual. I have been fighting everyday for myself, choosing to be alive and vital and even though it doesn't bring me happiness always it does bring me some moments of joy like this one, moments that I can share with the people that I love and have seen me in my worst and helped me through. And since reading you have helped me to understand myself more, to not feel lonely, to know that it is possible to keep moving even when it looks like it is the end for us, I wanted to share this with you, cause success means nothing to me if not shared.

2356,"Nothing is going well in my life : Nothing is ok in my life All my friends betrayed me th girl that i feel in love 2 years ago is now in a relationship with a good friend of mine. My bestfriend betrayed me because some false rumors about me literally everybody switched on me because some junkie told shit about me being a snitch and snitching on him and dealing with the guy who ripped him, but i wasn't even there i had nothing to with.So what happend its that the guy that spread the false rumors got ripped in a deal for pills (alot of pills like 3 thousand ecstasy pills), so that guy reached out to me so i can provide him pills because i was the plug. So i thought you know what if everybody switched on me im gonna switch on them too so i started dealing with this guy and apparently some guy in the group of the client still talks with the guy that spread the rumors and (we were good friends with that guy but he got heavy on drugs doing heroin, meth..) he called like im gonna kill you this and that i didnt got scared but i felt good because he owed me alot of money and i felt like: ""ok now that guy is out from my life"" i felt a relieve but then he started lying to all my friends and they believed him.Later i came to the city where all my friends were and i asked my best friend to come and smoke a joint with and talk a bit i was gonna tell him the truth and chat with him but was still paranoid. Then i told him to come to this place but i wasnt exacly at that place i was like in the other street watching if he would come alone, i was a bit high and then i thought: ""oh come on he is my best friend he wouldn't betray me""  and i went to the place and waited a couple minutes then i saw him coming with 2 guys more and they didnt look too friendly luckily they didn't see me, i ran i ran so fast and didnt look back they was up to something i remmeber that they had brass knuckles and knifes allways, i can fight im not scared to fight but they probably had knifes and they were three guys. I ran then i stoped i smoked a cigarette and felt so bad i didnt cry but that hurted me my best friend betrayed me, he asked me on messenger ""where are you?"" i left it on seen then he blocked me i really felt so bad i had nightmares for weeks about killing my friends, like shooting them or poisioning them.That was like a month ago, but then i see on facebook that this girl i felt really in love with her i loved her to death i saw her status: ""in relationship with...""  I was like damn fuck me a good friend of mine see was with him when i used to go to party with her and hanging out with her she claimed to be a lesbian and she said thats why i cant be with you she claimed that she got raped and she couldnt be with guys. I cried for her did alot of drugs because of her, when i saw her for the last time she said she didnt have much money i used to deal small amounts of drugs back then i emptied my pocked and showed her my dirty money and offered her money then she said: ""oh you are so childish.."" that broke my heart she was 21 and i was a kid 17 years old i really wanted her i gave up on everybody for her...I remmember we kissed in her room till 4 am we almost had sex but she said that she was scared so i said sorry and felt sad she said that we could be friends i said i should be going my mom is waiting for me she hugged me and i left in my moped i cried all the way home. Then 2 years later i see this i felt like shit she wants a bigger guy that can protect her and take for her but back i was i kid in her eyes..That was it guys everything is going wrong with my life. Well theres a couple of thing that are ok like im getting my driving license these day that is the only positive thing in my life right now but yeah i still feel like shit",2
2357,"Colorado : I finally visited Colorado to map out the next steps of my life. I'm staying in a dorm with a friend of mine that I've known for years via Instagram and finally got to meet her in real life after like six years of video chats and phone calls. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't in love with this girl. I mean she's everything I expected, and then some. She's energetic, very smart, beautiful, and we know each other very well. She's also taken by somebody a lot smarter than me that lives a lot closer to her. I know that if I tried to make a move at this point, it wouldn't be wise. My spiritual beliefs are what's keeping me secure. I believe in reincarnation, and therefore if I took her from this guy (or attempted), I'd simply be depriving myself in another life. It's shitty karma. She's been letting me sleep in her bed with her (not sexually; we don't cuddle or make physical contact really of any kind) and honestly it's enough. This girl makes me want to see the next day, every day. I didn't actually think I'd ever be able to meet her. It's almost like Pandora's box, now. I've found something in this life that's not only worth staying alive for but worth waiting for. She's told me her and her boyfriend don't see eye to eye on a lot of things long term. I'm not here to get in the way of her or their relationship. I just want to enjoy this time I have with her because it's only 11 days until I go back to Alabama. I'm not supposed to see her again until the summer. She wants to come see alabama and visit my home. And then I'm supposed to move up here eventually and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't for this girl. To her knowledge, I'm up here to look at colleges. Maybe this is really cringe but this has been the most bittersweet time I've ever had in my life and all I can do is be polite and try to have fun while I deal with all of my own nonsense. It has helped my depression though. It's given me a little more hope and more will to live. I just hope I don't fuck up.",2

2360,"Friendships going south, don't want to be all alone again : I'm not quite sure where to start. I'm in the military and it's going very badly. The last âproductiveâ?thing I've done is go through basic training which is literally the first step in anyone's military career. I have not become operational, I have not even started class or gone through any additional training. My âjobâ?is to exist and check in at certain times for accountability purposes, I don't even do anything as basic as janitorial work. I've also been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and a couple months back I struggled with substance abuse. I'm in the middle of a desert, too young to drink, in a rundown building that's illegally overcrowded. Could give more details on all of this if requested, but the point is I'm aware that I'm not doing too hot. That being said, my main focus has been bettering myself and not inflicting my pain on anyone else. Most of my friends have graduated and went on to another base or permanently discharged back home. I struggle with socializing and making new friends so when I make a friend I don't quite get attached or dependent but I do treat them better and tolerate more than someone with more connections would. This all being said, I'm not doing myself any favors by being passive.Last night I proceeded to pull the plug and piss all over it with a long term friend from back home. She's my age and we've known eachother since 2nd grade. I've done a lot for her over the years, mostly just verbal/emotional support. Like every single day on the bus until we could drive and then some. We stopped talking around that time but reconnected a couple months ago, and gradually I started expressing to her how I've always been depressed and suicidal I just keep it to myself but it's getting worse (esp with not having control over my life). She's told me it hurts for her to hear that and that she's always there for me if I needed it. She and her friend invited me over New Years and after expressing how suicidal I was she âcomforted meâ?until I stopped crying and then made up a story of her friend's sister being in the hospital and that they had to check on her, and I had to go home. I was shitfaced drunk and still shaking from the breakdown I'd just had and she lied to my face and sent me out into the cold to figure shit out. Anyways, I noticed some discrepancies and called her out on it last night. She âapologizedâ?but not really as there were more excuses for her behavior than genuine remorse. This isn't the first time she's fucked me over so I wasn't backing down and then she had her friend from that night start texting me too, which I ignored. She gaslighted me two weeks ago when I was home and she gaslighted me last night.Before that text last night I hung out with another girl on my base who is currently married. We actually met in a mental health institution and nearly got married but I cut it off. We gave eachother space, she ended up getting married to a different guy over Christmas, and now here we are the best of buds. I've felt wronged by her in the past, ex. she only talks to me when she's really low and needs someone to pull her up, but when I'm low or even neutral just bored and want to hang out she's always too busy. Generally I have kept it to myself, telling myself I'm just being pessimistic or jealous of her new bf/husband, but it's been feeling too often to be made up in my head. Last night she was low again so we went out for dinner. Even after eventually admitting to her that I was making plans to end my life just the day before (two days ago now) we mostly talked about her. I didn't get upset about it though I'm used to it. What did upset me was that she kept trying to get me and my waitress to flirt. She said she was cute and I agreed, I guess that's all she needed to hear to make awkwardly direct statements to our waitress that me and her were not together, I was single, flag her down randomly just to bring her to the table for me to talk to her, constantly be searching/staring at and talking about her the whole time once she started. I continuously told her to stop, maybe not assertively enough but my facial expressions, tone of voice and mannerisms went from relaxed smiles to tensed up uncomfortable playing with my straw saying I just wanted to go home. She even waived down another waitress to ask if ours was single (she wasn't, btw) because âI was interested in herâ? I didn't ask for any of this. I didn't encourage any of this. If I wanted to talk to my waitress I'd talk to my waitress myself. I felt humiliated and emasculating afterwards. I was upset and had nothing to say and she was texting on her phone so we didn't say anything on the way home. I was generally doing very well yesterday, lots of smiles and no stress. After dinner I was visibly upset with the exception of tears. We got back on base and she said she'd text me last night and I said alright see ya. Not to any surprise she didn't, but after texting girl#1 my neighbor I texted her too. I expressed that I understood she had good intentions but her actions upset me and that she said she'd text me but didn't. I said I wasn't mad upset or disappointed, I'm just sensing in general that I'm putting more energy into our relationship than she is. I apologized if I caused her any more stress while she's in class and wished her the best of luck. In the morning I got a structured reason 1, 2, 3, 4 reply of how she was innocent and how I've made her look bad. I told her that she's making herself look bad by bringing up my decisions and her reputation in the military when I was discussing our friendship. Then she said that broken people can't fix broken people, she'd done everything she could for me, and that she can't force me to âopen up and help myselfâ?because she's better than that. Also I should mention that in the past she's used my substance abuse against me in arguments.I'm sorry this is so long. I tried to stay on point and cut out a lot of details for whoever sees this but I seem to have fewer and fewer people to talk to. I'm going to cross post this.The first girl I wrote about, my neighbor, told me that I wasn't kind to her and I'm too dramatic to deal with. The second, my friend on base, thinks I'm a lost cause and ungrateful for our friendship. I have screenshots of both conversations.",2

I am a year older than him, but due to some rediculous reasons spent the last year studying in Australia (I am American) away from all my family. He is graduating highschool this June. We had made plans to move out together this summer and do our own thing. However, I got stuck in China after visiting my mother due to the coronavirus. It caused me to not return to Australia and I dropped out of my college. That nonsense aside, I told my stepbrother that'd I'd be ready to just move back to the US and start working until he graduated. But being stuck in China has reminded me how miserable I am. I guess surviving on my own for a year distracted me. Now I don't even remember what I'm doing. I've tried to find something I enjoy doing my entire life but I just can't find happiness out of anything. So now I feel stuck. I said I wanted to move out with him and start a new life doing our own thing. But I'm just going to end up disappointing myself. That's just going to make me end up disappointing him too. I'm not a happy person, and I feel like I just drag down the people around me. I've been putting off going back to the US because of this. I'm starting to feel suicidal again. I've gotten uncontrollably angry at myself, moody and I sometimes just cry until I can't feel my emotions anymore. I stay up as long as I can every day so I don't have to put effort into falling asleep. He tries to reach out to me casually but I don't  feel like I can even talk to him. He's such a great person, but I don't think he really understands how I feel. I feel gross thinking about telling him I'm still depressed. I had believed I could bring myself to live if it meant I'd be around him. But I just want to curl up and die. I don't know what I want and everything I try to live for ends up a disappointment.

Dirty dishes everywhere, clothing everywhere on the floor, food going bad, junk ect ect. I just felt so defeated because I have a tad of ocd/ germaphobia and I knew I'd spent ages cleaning once I started and it would tire me out and give me that dreaded reality check that I was such a disappointment for living in a dirty place.. So i just didn't even try. But now.. I just hit the 2 month mark where I keep my apartment clean, dishes are done ( I try to do it every day) , washing is done( my basket is empty, holy hell), clean sheets and regular vacuuming (room feels so light). I have no concept of time so I use songs and my coffee maker (lol) to keep track of time and do tidying up during a song of when I'm waiting for my coffee, laundry or food to cook. It feels bizarre and at first it felt like a big chore and voices in my head saying I was just faking being a clean person and it's pathetic but now tidying up is slowly becoming a part of me. I'm proud each time I put away things. It's weird how much easier it's getting and frankly I feel like I'm dreaming. I am even scared to even share this and be too happy about it.. Because I fear it will all go wrong now I told someone.  I'm slowly beating my mental illnesses ass (depression, anxiety, ptsd, borderline) but I still have a long way to go. I still need a job so I can start paying my month's overdue rent and not lose my apartment. But now I feel like I need to protect my little home and not give up.",2

2391,I wish I could end my life without actually ending it. : I'm not sure if that makes any sense but I really want my life to end without it actually ending. I would never try to kill myself again because my daughter is my motivation to be alive I would never take myself away from her. But outside of her I am not happy. I try to stay positive and be happy but it's just so hard. I feel like no matter what i do nothing is good enough and it's just wrong. i've been in a relationship with my boyfriend the father of my child for over 3 years. i know i'm not the only one that feels like i can't do anything wrong or that i'm just a burden i think everyone feels that way about me. even my boyfriend said if i'm alone i won't be able to deal with myself. I feel like i walk around with signs on my forehead that say âTREAT ME LIKE SHITâ?âBE MEAN TO MEâ?âBE FAKEâ?âLIE TO MEâ?âCHEAT ON MEâ? it's like i attract all the fake people. i just sit at home with my daughter all the time i never go out anymore if i do it's just to like go out to eat. i kind of miss when i was a freshman in high school and i thought i was the shit. people QUICKLY reminded me that i was not the shit at all and just in fact shit. i'm not sure what to do at this point as i try to feel good about myself but am constantly brought down by my boyfriend and parents. i feel like i'm not able to care about or focus on my own happiness and if i even try to for one second i'm called selfish. i try to make everyone happy and go a long with what they want because if i don't things are just worse. i have had problems with depression since I was in 7th grade. at first my boyfriend was helping now it seems to just be making it worse. i feel like just a huge burden on society and that i shouldn't have ever even been born in the first place.,2
2392,"Stopped taking care of myself and apartment found an angel to help : So about a year and a half ago I feel into a deep depression. Worse then I ever experienced. I was working 50+ hours a week as a substance abuse counselor and interventionist. I would come home and not be able to do anything. Not only was I not taking care of my apartment but I also stopped taking care of myself. After about 6 months of shame at how out of control my apartment had gotten I went to see a therapist. She did not think I had depression so much as burn out from my job. I saw her weekly and worked on just doing 1 thing each week to take care of myself and my apartment. Then the burn out really caught up to me and effected my job performance. I was let go but given the 300 hours paid leave I accrued and unemployment. I had never been more relieved in my life. I now had a cushion to take time to focus on my health and well being. My primary care doctor changed due to insurance and at my first physical she saw an anomaly in my records.  I had always had weight issues and it had been brushed off as bad diet and exercise by my former doctor and the endocrinologist she referred me to.  The new doctor noticed one thyroid test missing. Thyroid antibody test. After the results came back it showed that my Thyroid Antibodies were 100 times higher than normal. This means I had Hashimoto Thyroiditis. An auto immune disorder where your body attacks your thyroid like it is a virus. Causing lower metabalism(weight issues), sleep issues and chronic fatigue.  This coupled with my burnout is why I became so depressed. I was put on meds to help with weight as that was the only thing that could be treated for now. I was able to put a lot of work into my apartment and after 5 months found a new job I love without being overworked.  Now my apartment was a slow going process since I let it get so out of control. I got to a point were I got rid of bags and bags of trash and clutter. Just random things I held onto for no reason. I was cleaning up after myself as I went (washing dishes, taking out trash, sweeping) trying to make sure it didn't get worse. Then a month ago the building got roaches. I signed up with my neighbors for fumigation. The building manager sent me a letter that the exterminator had made horrible accusations about my apartment. That I had cat waste on my floor and I lived like a hoarder. I was angry and devastated. One thing I always did was take care of my cat. So this was just not true. And after getting rid of so much stuff to have this said was devastating.  They said they would come back in a week. I found even more things to get rid of. Clothes, small appliances even one of my tvs. I bought a new litter box and litter tracking mat for my cat. I vacuumed every spec of cat litter. Only to be told no change and we need to discuss next steps. Now I was angry. When I asked what the issue was, stating I did what they asked. I was told clutter isn't the problem your apartment is too dirty. This is a bait switch I feel. But whatever. I made the appointment and was told they would do a new inspection at that time if I wanted. So I looked around and was lucky enough to find a wonderful woman who agreed to deep clean my apartment for only 65$. She is here now and already the difference is huge. The layers of grime of the floor and in my bathroom are gone. I promised myself I will never get to this place again. I acknowledge I let things get out of control but wish my building manager had been more straight forward and clear as to what they took issue with. I will update after my meeting but thanks to this wonderful woman I don't see an issue.",2

2415,"Just smile : I'm not sure if anyone is going to read this but if you do, I want to tell you about why you should be grateful for what you have, and I'm talking about whatever you have.I used to be an orphan, my father had a heart attack in 2004 and my mom died from cancer in 2005. I lost both parents by the time I turned 6. This has been the worst experience of my life and one I have accepted I cannot forget but deal with. There was very little caring. Every time I tried to replace my family members with the attenders, I failed terribly. Later when I was around 7 years I realized family can never be replaced. Becoming an orphan broke me, and shattered everything I believed in. The worst part is that no one around you understands what you go through and feel everyday. After my mom passed in 2005, I returned to boarding school and became a completely different person, without trying. I was alone, and scared. I wept everyday. I lost interest in everything that mattered to me and couldn't keep things together. I became extremely quiet and shut myself out. I started struggling academically, I couldn't study without crying or remembering my parents. I couldn't focus. I was suffering emotionally. I had no one, absolutely no one to talk to. No one in my family ever reached out to me or said ""everything was going to be okay"". I hated visiting day, because parents came over and had fun with their kids and all I wanted was to have at least one parent visit. I somehow still believed they could come back and I prayed to God everyday for hours. I became extremely religious in that time. I felt vulnerable, there was no one to fight for me, no one to love me unconditionally and I was no longer protected. I lost my trust in people and realized how selfish people were.We always get old and torn stuff to wear and play. No one ever donates fresh clothes or toys to orphaned children. Till 11 years old I have never worn a dress of my size, always oversized, and I used to long for a rich kids birthday celebration so I could get to eat cake lmaoWhenever the attenders look at you, you have to be either studying or praying or else you would get beaten up. I remember being abused physically for being slow in certain things. Wooden spoons to the mouth if you don't finish your food or spill your food, tight slaps across the face, buttock spankings with hangar and others. There was never a day without screaming.Fast forward to when I'm doing my SPM...I knew that nobody would adobt me at this age, and when I hit 18 I would age out and have to fend on my own. So I did my best for spm, though I didn't score straight A's, my results were decent enough for me to get in sunway.Fast forward to when I'm 18, aged out. Just like that I'm out...I have to fend for myself. Slept on the streets on the first few days, depressed and homeless. But I didn't give up.I was lucky enough that my parents left some money and so I used that solely for my education in college and had to figure everything else out. Like clothes, etc. I worked by teaching kids over the holidays to provide some of these cravings.I became very independent quickly and I had no one telling me what to do. In fact, I wish I had someone who cared enough to tell me what to do. I became very emotional, quick-tempered and defensive. I put up a wall and didn't want to get hurt by anyone or anything, and avoided everything. I couldn't handle my emotions and I attributed every hurtful situation to not having my parents around. I contemplated suicide every day.Overtime, I have felt insecure, and it's very hard for me to trust, but once I trust someone or something, there's no turning back. I have a very big heart and would do anything to help anyone. My struggles and experiences has enabled me to appreciate everything around me and wish the best for everyone. Before I  became positive, I despised the word, I was angry, and hated everyone who had a parent or was supported through life. I guess I was jealous and didn't understand why life had thrown this at me. I decided during my high school days, to turn everything around and fight for myself and my future. I knew I wouldn't have anyone supporting me, and so I was ready to battle it. I set goals for myself and till today, I take it one step at a time.Life is still not easy, I'm facing racial discrimination in work place and in classcalling me names like K-word,robber,rapist jokingly under the mask of humour to hurt me but I'm not letting that affect me. If you are not my friend, I couldn't give a damn about what you think or say about me.My experiences has made me tough. I appreciate love, even though it's difficult to love, because I'm afraid of losing them. Being an orphan sucks, it's a tough, depressing, lonely, annoying and despiteful life and takes a lot of courage to make the decision to be a better person.However, all these experiences toughen will up anyone and there is nothing you cannot overcome because you have seen it all, have a really good heart,  genuinely care about others, and want to make the world a better place.Last week was my first time celebrating my birthday with my friends who I call my family in over 18 years, it made me really grateful thinking about...although it was nothing grand..they still came for me. Thats why I chose to make to post to open you peoples eyes so that you can be grateful for the life you've been given.FYI: I'm answering anonymously because I do not want my friends and colleagues to see this post and feel sorry for me. I am moving on with my life and I do not like to be reminded, or treated specially because of my story. Have a good day and just try to smile at least once, I know its hard sometimes...but don't give up.",2

2426,"neighbor giving me hard time : So i have conflict with my barbarian neighbor, the story began back to a year and half ago when I told his friend not to park his car in front of my house gate and blocking my car inside. After more than a week, one night he was drunken and seek revenge by asking his friend parked his car at the same spot again after I went out. When I came home and request his friend politely to move his car away he then threaten and provoked me for a fight. I knew he took alcohol because of his asian flush face. I was thinking to call the police at that time but I don't want to create too much attention since my family has slept.The next morning, I went to his home and requested an explanation and told him I was about to call the police if necessary. Then I found that he was actually having mouth fight with his wife since  yesterday and then I saw 3 of his kids, 3 of them age between 3 to 5. I was sympathy to his kids because I was unsure what will happen to his kids if he got jailed or something so I changed my mind. Her wife was scared and kept apologized to me.But this guy never give up to provoke and threaten me. All these years, from time to time, When ever he heard my family and I are having dinner and chatting in the kitchen area , he will ask his kids to scream purposely to catch our attention or create deep thump sound with either pushing table to the wall or by his fist whenever he has chance. Many times he did that during midnight after 2 am and causing me to move my bed room to another room.He only make the deep thump sound once and stop for like an hour more and continue again. I was thinking to confront him about this but thinking that he might said that his foot hit something accidentally.  Sometimes when he has fight with his wife, he also slam the door at the kitchen and the sound freaks my family out because the door was made of metal.My mum and sis afraid of him because his body size is larger than me, they afraid he might hurt me or something. Both of them ask me to ignore him. But he keeps harassing us and even teach his kids doing the same (hit the wall with something hard).Whenever i heard his sound and knew he is in his house, my heart will start racing. I am not afraid of him because I know what he's doing is wrong. But my family won't allow me to confront with him. That really make me sick and feel like to move out as soon as I get a new job, but what about my family. They refuse to move because my passed away dad bought the house with my mum. Many memories that my mum do not want to give up. I wish I have money to hire lawyer but i don't have that extra funds. Any suggestion will be appreciated.",2

Honestly, it was like a sudden downpour on a sunny day-- scrolling on reddit, feeling ""okay"" then suddenly sobbing, struggling to breathe and wanting to just....end. My poor pup was snuggled next to me and didnt seem like he knew what to do. He wiggled closer, licked at my face and let me wrap myself around him and break down. The crying has stopped, but the mental fog has firmly settled in and I'm exhausted.My pup is good-- happy snuggling, cuddly, but I feel awful for freaking him out with my break down.",2

2440,I don't know what to do : So first of all English isn't my first language . But nontheless i'll try my best.  I have been finding myself in a situation for the last 3 years . And I am not able to get myself out of it.   I have a severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I already made clear with myself that i won't commit suicide. I've always been very curious and inquisitive and i don't what to miss anything in the future. That's why I could never do it. BUT that doesn't stops me from thinking about it. I think I know the 2 main reasons for my depression. My family and my social life better to say lack there of. My family actually seems like the nice family from next door. We never had any money problems or anything like that. But on the inside my family is falling apart. My biggest brother confessed last year to my mother that he is depressed and he couldn't go to work that day because he couldn't be sure he wouldn't drive his car in a wall. He went to a op psychiatric clinic. At first it seemed like my mother and him would start to get back together and were starting to build up a strong bond between them. But then it all went south. They only were fighting when she would visit him. It got to that point that my brother broke with my family and as he got out of the clinic he moved out. My mother is a mess since she knew about his depression. I think it's because that she thinks she messed up as a mother. But she doesn't only think that because of my biggest brother my second brother. Is also drifting away from us. He gets aggressiv real fast and is almost never at home. Only to sleep.. Sometimes not even that. My little sister shows signs of a depression too for a while now. She doesn't have any good friends in school and the story of my brother seems to do also a great part on her. No we finally get to me. I also don't have any good friends. There is nobody I could talk to. But first I want to finish the part about my family. I am kind of a geek. So as soon I noticed some weird behavior of my dad. I installed a software on his laptop. 2 Days later I got the result I was waiting for. He used multiple dating sites to flirt with other women I couldn't find out if he already met with someone but I believe that he did. Anyway I got him to stop it. At least he doesn't use sites like these on his laptop anymore. I didn't talk to him. I don't want to say how I did it but I believe it worked. He doesn't know that I know about his secret. But I am still in a dilemma. Do I tell my mom about it and definitely destroy our family and let my sister grow up with divorced parents or do I keep it for myself and I can't look my father in the eyes. I have kept everything secret for 2 years now. But still haven't decided what to do. My current plan is to break with my family in few years. As soon as I am financially stable enough to life on my own. I don't want to risk needing to come back to my family because of financial problems or anything like that. My second problem is my social life. As I already said i have no real friends. That is not really true I do have a friend. My best friend. But we after school he moved to another city. We rarely see each other. And each year it gets less. I can't talk to him about my problems because he got some weight to carry aswell and I don't want him to be concerned about me. I am singel for 3 years now. I only had one girlfriend. And she was abusive towards me. Since that I almost never talked to a girl of my age group outside of work. And I feel that I am drifting closer towards the abyss each day. I wake up go to work get home go into my room and go to sleep. There is rarely something that disturbs that circle. My biggest fear is if I break with my family and move to another city that I won't meet new friends. And in the end I die alone. With no fun in life. I don't know what to do and how to get out of this situation.   I just felt like sharing my story/ current life situation with you guys.   And I am really sorry for the long post.,2
2441,"I hate my fucking brain : I discovered this subreddit today, and i have been reading a few posts. And i have readed some that describe situations where depression isn't validated at all, or feel themselves that they don't deserve to feel better, which obviously doesn't help. I feel that way too, but the more fucking disgusting thing is that I already have been a year in home, doing nothing but going to several therapists, and even then, I didn't progress even a bit, because or he/she doesn't ask me to give my opinion or express myself, or he/she doesn't speak a word and i have to progress myself from almost nothing, if you have been to a psychoanalyst you'll know what im talking about. And it's already difficult to talk about it, even more when you feel that you are complaining for nothing, and you are afraid to say that you are not following what he/she said you to do at all because it's hard. And that's exactly what encloses you in a loop, thinking you don't deserve to be comprehended, not communicating with your therapist and lying about your progress, not progressing because of that, and feeling more guilty. I don't know if I have expressed myself correctly and can be understood, but that's what i can say at the moment. I'm conscient of the depression symptoms, but even so it's a constant fight against your thoughts and the way your reasoning works, and every hour i change between thinking that it's reasonable to feel bad, and feeling guilty for it. I  don't know who's fault is I'm afraid to tell my therapist how I really am, well, actually now I say it, it's probably beacuse the first therapist i've been in my life and I've been again last year is fucking rude, and it's the same my father has been going to untill the beginning of last year... for like 15 years. Not good. So basically i have to try to be honest. So easy. That's all, I wanted to say it somewhere.",2

The few people I meet online only ever talk about themselves and never seem to reach out to me when I briefly stop asking them the questions. Why does it feel like I'm only here to be used before I eventually get ghosted, seemingly thrown away, no matter how much time and energy I give to keep the connection going? I don't understand. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high? Do people just get bored of me once the spotlight shifts, even temporarily, from them? Am I just inherently unlikable?My heart hurts from this isolation, but I fear reaching out to the few people I have in my life because many of them feel like I've no right to complain just because my life looks less burdensome on the surface.I've built a shell around myself that exhibits independence and self-sufficiency, not because I fear letting people in, but because I despise feeling disappointment time and time again from people who I assumed cared. I want to feel vulnerable and thought about for once. I hate always being there for others, but forced to face my demons alone. I hate it, I hate, *I hate it.*I'm just tired at this point. Is life gonna be like this forever? It doesn't help that there are so many others like me, but I feel helpless because I just feel burnt out caring about others without reciprocation too many times.

2448,"Crying to the point of wanting to claw my face off : Just as the title says, my chest is hurting too much and I have so much weight on my heart. My husband doesn't seem to appreciate what i do. He works during the week while I take care of our baby, and he says to me he'd rather stay home watching baby than go to work. Now to me, that seems to imply that caring for a baby is easier than his job. Well it's not, and it's pretty much driving me into the deep end and I want to hurt myself. I've cried with such anger that I dug my fingernails into my flesh causing pain and at the same time relief that I could feel it.And I know you're probably gonna say "" oh that's PPD doctors can give you meds/go see a therapist"" yadda yadda.. I'm tired of hearing it. I'm only writing this because I have no where else to vent and get off my chest. I'm beginning to wonder if the ones who experience depression are meant to so they would eventually take their lives to trim the human population since we really don't have a natural predator to maintain population.. but then again, we are our own predator since we kill off each other through wars, difference of opinion, and just plain stupidity.That's another thing that upsets me. There are way too many people inventing shit that they feel is justified and then push it on others when they don't agree. We don't even abide the laws of nature, instead we corrupt it and even laugh at it. When I was younger, everything was awesome and never had to deal with the social problems that are going on now. I mean, where the fuck did that even come from!? It makes me sick and hate living surrounded by that shit, I don't even watch TV because it disgusts me too much. I don't want to live any longer having to deal with it .. it's too much wasted energy.Ah fuck it.",2
2449,"Yes, I'm Clingy. And I'm Sorry. : I've always been the clingy type. And I've always been criticized for it. Main reason I am such is because I wasn't shown hardly any physically affection when I was young. I can barely recall my parents having ever hugged me as a child. And even when they did it was usually awkward. And knowing who they really are now makes me wonder if any of it was even genuine. Either way, being âclingyâ?is not something society is fond of. It's regarded as annoying, stupid, childish, unnecessary, etc. And I've had people say it to me. Like my dad saying, âYou shouldn't cling to your sister in law like that. It gets on her nerves.â?And she is the type to literally shake my hand off if I try to hold her hand, so I eventually stopped trying. A couple friends of mine don't like physically contact much, so they are the type to actually push you off if you touch them. Like my one friend literally shouted âNope!â?and snatched her hand away when I tried once. And the other friend had to give me a sincere talk about it after asking her mom how to approach me on the matter. I get it, not everyone likes that. And I respect the people who don't, even when they express it in a rude or unkind manner. But boy does it really add to my self hate. Even my one friend who doesn't mind it will jokingly say things like, âI know, you're clingy.â?And she's right I am. She may mean no harm by saying it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't do harm regardless. And now people aren't allowed to touch each other due to the coronavirus going around. But at this point, who cares? I never got physical affection before anyway? Why would I worry about it now? At least, that's what I tell myself. And others.I laugh it off. I respect others wishes and space. I brush it off and pretend like it doesn't hurt. But it really, really, really, does. Especially when I haven't been shown any affection by the people who were supposed to care the most. I remember reading an article on a mans life story. He had a horrid childhood and almost died as a result of his parents neglecting him. He mentioned how he remembered being a little boy in his crib, and he'd bawl his eyes out when visitors came by. Just because he wanted to be held. But everyone ignored him. I'd never cried after reading something like that before, but I did. I'm crying just writing about it now. And I did because it struck a cord with me. I can't remember anything really specific but I do know there were times all I wanted was to be held/reassured by my parents, like any child should be, but I wasn't. I was pushed away, yelled at, mocked, and called âclingy.â?And they were right. I was. I am. And I'm sorry. I'm really truly sorry. I'm sorry wasn't shown enough love as child. I'm sorry I don't have many real friends who understand my feelings. I'm sorry I was wasn't even kept by the parents that actually created me and will probably never know them. I'm sorry I ended up adopted by a family who didn't really care. And I'm sorry all those things made me who I am. I don't WANT to be clingy. I never wanted to be. I'm sorry I am. I wish I wasn't. I wish I wasn't me. I wish I was dead, and then I wouldn't have be this thing that people despise. Again, sorry to all the people that have labeled me as âclingy.â?I assure you, when I die, I won't be. Ever again.",2

2452,"I feel my boyfriend drifting but I don't know how to help : Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on this website, but I'm really just looking for advice. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 5 months, the first two months or so were awesome, we were always together or texting or sending each other memes, then most this stopped happening. I figured he might've been going through something and he just needed his space. We're both introverts so I've been there, I also need space from people so I've been giving him his space for a couple months. Today, I went and visited him while he was working (we work together and I had the day off but I occasionally visit him while he's working) and I could tell he looked super tired, and not just from lack of sleep. I could sense that he was down more than I'd ever seen him before, and a lot of the things that I had seen in him I'd also seen in me previously. I was diagnosed with depression four years ago and I've learned to manage it, but a lot of what I was seeing and what he was explaining to me that he was feeling was very similar to how I use to feel before I was diagnosed and I had no idea what was going on. Later that day, I wrote down everything that has helped me, hoping that he might connect with something I had also experienced. He took it pretty well, said thank you, but since then I've noticed small things that kind of scare me. Like he jokes about wanting to die or he want's life to end, but he points out that he would never actually kill himself and that he promises that he's just joking. I'm just worried and I'm not sure what I can do about it, if I can do anything, like suggesting he see a professional? Has anyone else been in this situation before, what have you done if you have been? Thank you in advance :) I really appreciate anyone that's taken the time to read this.",2

I surprised my boyfriend with a trip to Boston to see his favorite band. I plan birthday dinners. I put in so much effort and time into friendships. I take everything into consideration, the things they like, the things they don't like, things they've always wanted. I never ask for much but for them to pick up the phone once a month if I call them during a mental breakdown, and that's if I even decide to reach out for help. I just wonder if these people that I care a lot about would ever do the same for me. For once I would just like to be shown some sort of appreciation.

2466,"Stress and feeling like a failure. : Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to keep it as brief as possibleI'm a 22 (almost 23) year old trans women engaged with my girlfriend of three years, and together we have a one year old son. I love them both more than anything. However with an active life of work, fiance, and taking care of a child, I feel incredible amounts of stress. It always seems like on my days off there's just one more thing to take care of, or an errand that requires my time. I usually don't have that much free time as I'm constantly busy with keeping my family afloat. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, they mean the world to me, but holding it all together is taking its toll on me. On top of that I have depressive and gender dysphoric episodes. I feel that my depression stems from ""not being good at anything."" I want to be good at... something. At this point, I'll take anything. My two major hobbies are competitive Super Smash Bros Melee, and I get sad about constantly losing, but I also don't internalize that sadness as much because I don't take it super seriously and its more for fun than anything (though watching your rank on the constant decline on the community leader board can really be a bummer at times). My other major Hobby that I am more concerned about is drawing. I've been taking art classes since I was in 7th grade and I was even in AP art. I constantly have a feeling that I'm never improving. 2010-2015 I used to draw for school, and some for fun fan art stuff on the side when I was a nerdy teenager, but 2015 through now, I've hardly done anything. I've made maybe like 3 or 4 completed pieces of digital art and even then I'm not that confident about them. When ever I try to draw today, I just get like, almost physically I'll. I feel like my stomach drops and my heart rate goes up. At work, I have a lot of free time and I try to practice on yellow stickie notes at work but most of the time I usually crumple them up and toss them because I end up not being satisfied. I know that's kinda considered a no no in the art community, but I've been doing this ever since I got a three out of five on my final AP Art portfolio. I tore up a myriad of my AP art portfolio because a lot of it involved self portrait and those drawings of myself were before I even transitioned to female. I want so bad to find time to practice my art, but not even that, just being able to know and internalize that it doesn't have to be perfect, and mistakes are part of learning. But everytime I get to work I just get really really fucking sad and I feel like I'm not ever going to improve because I've been at this for 10 years now. What's particularly upsetting to me is that I have ADHD, so focus is already a big issue. I want to hone in my attention on my art, but get so discouraged when I see people have actually completed a number of sketchbooks, meanwhile I struggle to even get one started and even when I do get started on one, I fill in like two or three pages and then don't pick one up again for months. Digital art is also a big frustration as the number of tutorials, art styles, tricks, etc. are just endless on the internet and with someone like me, it's hard to sit down and actually learn. I can't make it through 5 minutes through an art tutorial of any sort because I just.. I dunno... get antsy and go watch a Melee clip or a video essay. I don't know how I can easily sit through an hour long video essay about Marxism or whatever, but the moment it comes to the things I really care about, I just can't force myself to pay attention and absorb the learning material. I have a long shot dream of making a Sci-Fi cartoon one day. I don't know how to even come close to it considering I can't pay for college, let alone negotiate (argue) medical Bill's with my insurance company in relation to my transition, being barely able to afford the means to keep my family stable, not having enough time to practice, and even if I find time to practice, I just don't out of anxiety or contempt of self. It depresses me that I can rationally argue that my dream won't come true and that I'm just going to work a bullshit job for the rest of my life because I just can't get it together. I have days of crying spells where I sit in the shower and have crying fits over gender Dysphoria, depression, and just feeling like a massive failure. TL;DR: I suffer from ADHD, Gender Dysphoria, and a busy schedule. I feel those things are getting in the way of me improving at hobbies I want to otherwise improve at, and I feel like a failure for not being able to meet goals",2
2467,"I have a lot to say : I am not a person who wants to kill themselves nor do I have too many depressive thoughts. Im just not ok.

2471,My mom made me feel like shit : I've felt like complete shit especially this last month it's normally pretty bad but this month has been complete shit. Nothing bad happened in my life but I'm so fucking sad. I'm so sad I can't get out of bed and I just cry myself to sleep and think about dying. I'm in bed listening to music all day and I can't do my schoolwork I can't do chores I can hardly move. Tonight I told my mom it's hard for me to do homework and asked if I could skip school and she raised her voice at me and said I'm not even trying I'm just on my phone all day but I can't do anything else it's so hard and I'm so fucking mad. She's a fucking therapist and she told me it's my fault I'm not trying but I am it's just impossible. Normally I'd just get high and fall asleep and forget about it but the psychiatrist is getting me blood testing me soon so I can't do anything cuz I don't wanna be denied meds. I'm so mad at her and I'm just sad I thought she was on my side but idek anymore I thought a therapist would be more understanding but she just made me feel like shit during one of the shittiest time of my life by blaming me for being lazy cuz I'm on my phone but if I was able to do stuff I would and I just hurt myself a little bit nothing too bad but I usually don't do it at all. I doubt anyone's gonna read this but just had to rant,2

2474,"How a past love is affecting my relationship with my sister. : Ever since high school I've always felt like the guy who has to start plans or conversations to feel involved. It started this persistent feeling of loneliness and sorrow that I feel like is persistent most of the time now. I had a girl I was very much in love with, we talked all day everyday for almost 2-2 1/2 years,  one day she just stopped talking to me and I had to find out through a mutual friend that she felt that I was creepy and overbearing. Now almost 3 years later it still bothers me, and I don't feel like I'm worth love and kindness anymore.Leading to the more relevant problem, I'm living with my sister and their girlfriend. Most days are ok, but I have this nagging feeling that I'm not wanted, I dont get told good morning or good night, i dont get included in plans, i very rarely get opportunities to talk to or do something with my sister alone. I've tried voicing my concerns before, and I get reassurance that I'm very loved, but then nothing changes, I might as well not exist again.I dont know if im just emotional and hyper aware of things now that my therapist is having me dredge up thoughts and feelings about my old relationships, but I'm very scared that things that have ruined my relationships before are happening again, and it would destroy me if I had to face a day when my sister doesn't want a relationship with me.",2
2475,How does antidepressants help with depression??? : [removed],2
2476,"Why I feel like I'm not good enough : Deep down, my darkest desire is simply to feel loved and wanted.  And so I say things like ""I wish I had a girlfriend,"" but that probably gives the impression that I'm desperate and just trying to fit in. But that's not what I really mean. Yes, I'm at this age where most of my friends are in relationships. People might describe me as being in the ""prime of my youth"", but if this is the best it's going to be I'm afraid for what comes next. And then there's me. I've never been in a relationship, in fact I've never really had intimate connections with another person before. Honestly, I don't know how to. I go through each day as if nothing's wrong, but deep inside I'm  lonely.  And I truly wish that I could have someone who really understands me and will love and accept me for who I am. My friends tell me it's better to be single because being in a relationship comes with a host of its own problems. Others tell me that I just need to be patient, because things will work out eventually. That there are plenty of fish in the sea, that it's just not my time yet, that it's not something I should worry about. You name it, I've heard it. And I agree with them, because for all I know they could be right. But in light of all this, I still don't feel happy.  When most people that I know are in relationships now, and I find it difficult to even connect with people, I can't help but feel like I'm not good enough. Like I'm not worthy. Like there's something wrong with me. Because if there isn't, why is my life like this? So yes, I say things like ""I wish I had a girlfriend."" Because I don't want to feel like shit any longer. I don't want to feel like there's something horribly wrong with me. It's not because I want to be like everyone else, it's because I want to feel like I'm worth something.",2

Especially since I tried to commit suicide on that day. It was last year. But ever since then, I've kept a mask on. I've just been hiding everything I've been feeling. I don't think I've gotten better. I think I just got better at tolerating it and being in my head and pretending to be this super happy, confident person. It's been working, nobody really bats an eye and ever thinks somethings wrong. It's been working for the past 4 months since that time. I've been having really bad self harm urges and recently I cut again, around a week ago. I relapsed. I know for sure if I hadn't lived here and had been living somewhere else I'd just be cutting and cutting and cutting, but I can't because of the living situation I'm in and if I get caught again there will be serious consequences. Lately it feels like the mask has been slipping. I've been getting quieter and quieter and I'm starting to isolate myself more. I go to school everyday and I've been trying so hard to work on my grades but it's so difficult. I don't think people really understand it. I want to do good in school, but my concentration is so shit because of all the other shit I think about, all the shit that I keep in my head. I won't reveal any of it, but the effects of it are starting to show I think. I'm so so tired. At this point it just feels like I am tolerating life. I'm just tolerating the mental stress that nobody thinks is going on anymore. I'm so tired..",2

The year started off with me trying a new medicine for my anxiety. That kept me from being able to focus on anything. Then my uncle passed away from a heart attack. Only a few weeks later a good friend of mine passed from Leukemia. My depression has been getting worse and worse, as well as my anxiety. This years GPA is a 1.75. I'm entire semesters behind everyone else and I'm crying trying to figure out how to get back up. Nobody will help me when I ask. It's always the same âyou should've paid attentionâ?replies.

2506,"Will I ever be ""good enough""? : My husband was recently diagnosed with throat cancer. For the last several weeks I've been taking care of him and driving him back and forth to the hospital for his chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Last night he asked me if I would have married him again knowing he'd end up getting cancer. ""Of course,"" I told him, ""I love you and I can't imagine my life without you."" I didn't even have to think about it because the answer seemed obvious to me.I asked him if he would have married me again knowing how debilitating my depression can be. He was silent for a long time. Then he said, ""I think so."" That was not the answer I was expecting and it absolutely devastated me. I knew it was an honest answer, too, because my husband never lies to me. It hurt to hear the person who loves me and knows me the best admit that being married to me might not be worth the effort. He unknowingly confirmed one of my greatest fears: that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be ""good enough"" to be in a relationship.I've done everything I can to cope with my depression. I've spoken to numerous therapists and tried at least half a dozen different antidepressants and antipsychotics. I force myself to venture out into the world and socialize with others even when I don't feel like it. I eat healthy meals and exercise on a regular basis. Still, my life is riddled with unbearable sadness and frequent thoughts of suicide. I try to conceal my depression from my loved ones as much as possible, so that I'm not a burden to them (and so they won't leave me), but some days the emotional pain is so overwhelming that it seems to burst out of me. Today is one of those days.  Being married to someone with cancer puts me in a tough position. Everyone expects me to be ""strong"" for my husband, which essentially translates to me ignoring my own needs so I can be there for him 24/7. I'm dealing with a lot right now, but complaining about my own problems would seem selfish and trivial in comparison to what my husband is going through. Caretaking is a thankless job. I have to suffer silently while my husband's loved ones cheer him on and praise him for being such a strong fighter. They don't know what happens behind closed doors. They don't see me deflecting my husband's hurtful insults when the steroids make him irritable. They don't see me cooking his meals, washing his clothes, or scrubbing his shit off the bathroom floors and walls when the chemotherapy makes him lose control of his bowels. It's not easy, but I'm willing to do all of these things because I genuinely love my husband. That's why it hurt me so much when he insinuated that I might not be worth marrying again. I'm in a lot of pain right now and I need to talk to someone about it. Unfortunately my therapist doesn't have an opening available for the next two weeks. My husband would be the next obvious choice, but I don't want to tell him how I'm feeling because he already has enough to deal with. I can't talk to our friends about it either because they would think I was being selfish.Have any of you ever had similar experiences?",2

I don't know how to explain the situation without sounding crazy, because it does sound crazy, why would I date someone I actively hated for 2 years? Why wouldn't I just leave when I realized I was being abused? I DONT KNOW. Its because I was being manipulated and threatened that if I left I would be responsible for her suicide. Its because I was tricked into alienating all my friends so if left I would have nobody left. Its because when I was still in the hospital after overdosing she continued to tell me how I was selfish I was being. Its how she told everyone I attempted and then blamed my best friend for the reason the whole student body knew I was gone.

2516,"Harrassment on Twitter : I am an environmental engineer who studies air pollution. I have a friend who is a war correspondent in Syria. He posted before and after satellite images of Syria at night before the war and at the present day to show how many people have left the country and how much of the electricity grid has been disabled. He wrote a column a while back about the environmental consequences of the Syrians war.  Given my research focus, I was intrigued. I commented on these satellite photos, in reference to his article, that a silverlining of ISIS has been a reduction in air pollution in Syria.  However, the human cost has been tremendous.  Yet, I remember you also wrote that artillery, bombs, and munitions are causing forest and brush fires, so I may be wrong.I checked my twitter and had tons of hate messages claiming I was an ecofascist, a war criminal, and I was saying the Syrian Civil War was a good thing. The ring leader was a guy who like me works in sustainability. He paraphrased my comment and claimed that the Syrian War was good because it killed people, and dead people dont create pollution. He then retweeted this and got his followers to dogpile me, telling me to fuck off and saying I am a genocidal maniac.I apologized. I acknowledged that my comment was callous, and I deleted it. Many of the people who initially went me hate mail apologized to me. My friend, the war correspondent stuck his neck out and told me and his followers that I wasn't a monster. However, the initial guy that misquoted me as saying war is good because it kills people and reduces emissions refuses to acknowledge or admit his mistake. I reached out. I apologized. I deleted the comment that triggered him. But he continues bashing me on his twitter. He makes me so mad because he and I work in the same field sustainability. As a liberal, I get hate from the alt-right  all the time calling me a reactionary SJW for bringing up climate change or air pollution. They will claim I have misquoted them even when I link to their articles.

She also won't even sit next to me anymore and even when I stand next to her she moves away completely ignoring my existence. She talked to everyone else in the class more than she does to me. Even once she wanted a hug from someone and everyone was like âhug your boyfriendâ?and she gave me a one second one handed hug while looking away from me and everyone was like wtf. Everyone in my class doesn't know what's up with her. Even my teacher noticed what's going on. I don't want to sound egotistical and ignorant but I did nothing wrong. This behavior just came out of nowhere. Even all my friends and my teacher don't know what's going on with her. I've been trying my best to be a really good boyfriend to her. I've never tried to go against her, I've never put her down or even gotten in an argument with her. Even every time I look at her I smile. Over the past week she has only actually talked to me once where we actually had a back and forth conversation that she started. This whole thing has not been helping my mental state. Every time I think about her I get depressed because I see her smiling and actually talking to other people and I just wish she was doing that to me. I've been on a school field trip for a few days and I've been chugging down my antidepressants. Once this trip is over I'm going to break up with her.",2

I've been fighting with depression for over 15 years but this feels like a new low.  I'm trying to be a little humorous while venting about everything here.  Could be triggering for some? * A major tornado hit less than a mile from our home.  (We were fine, no damage or casualties to friends or family)* I didn't get to vote.  Local polling station was out of power.  Traffic was too screwed up to get anywhere and I wasn't up for the challenge of getting to an alternate location.* I'm extremely burnt out with my work (2 jobs, planned to quit one but situations have changed)   I seriously can't will myself to get up in the morning and I can't will myself to sit down and focus on the side-hustle anymore.  Been this way for several months.* My young child is acting like a total jerk.  We're walking on eggshells rn.* My wife's feeling overwhelmed and exhausted with everything in general.* An old friend of my wife died.* Coronavirus is in my state now.  I have no willpower and I'm anxious about going out and stocking up on some supplies in case of a quarantine.* Our house is a total fucking mess.  None of us have the willpower to get it clean, yet we're anxious and miserable because of it.* My vehicle is pissing fluid everywhere under the hood from an unknown source.  I have no care to fix it right now.* I have a got damn fucking toothache from hell.  Probably about to blow all my savings on getting that fixed.* I should maybe call my therapist, but I feel it's a lost cause.  I'll go in yet again, spend gobs of money, and get nowhere.  At least I have 3 refills left on my meds.* I can't stop eating crap food no matter how I try.  The bathroom scale won't even tell me my weight anymore.  Just ""H"". I assume that means heavy.How's your week?",2

The whole idea of being successful is so confusing to me. I have all of this good stuff going for me but when I'm with myself, I feel hopeless, empty, and sad. I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago now and I remember ppl saying that you just learn to live with it. Sometimes I question my whole existence. Sometimes I think I'll be better off not here. That's just how I feel. The hopelessness in life just makes me feel that way. I never think I'm enough. How can I feel like I'm enough?

She made me be a better person. And without her I don't know what to do. I don't know what my interests are. I don't know who I am. And I don't know how to figure it out without using the outside world to mold me into some brain dead robot. I want to know the real me. I don't want to be what society says a 26F should be.

I feel like I need to curl up into a ball and cry a long good honest cry where I just let out all my feelings and not judge myself for it. I have been gardening all day. I hoped that the gardening would help me feel better. But instead I feel really sad. I just feel like I have so much more to do and whatever I am doing is not enough. I feel physically exhausted but can't sleep because I have this really sad feeling. I'm sure if I thought long and hard about it, I would figure out what is really making me sad right now but I don't really want to do that right now because I also know that I have depression and this is just apart of having depression. There will be good days and bad days and I just have to take things one day at a time. :/  I have many reasons why I feel sad. I have ptsd so I have a lot of painful traumatic events and memories that haunt me to this day that tend to bring my spirits down a lot. It is very easy for me to feel sad because it is easy for me to dislike myself and feel sad over everything I do, and everything that I am as a person. I am trying my best not to let my sad thoughts take me down to a dark place. I'm trying my best not to believe my nihilistic, pessimistic, self sabotaging, depressing, negative thoughts. Writing this out might be my only proof that I am at least trying to fight depression right now. I've tried to play video games, listen to music, eat good food, care for others, watch tv, but nothing has been able to take away the deep sadness that I feel right now. :/ I'm going to try and do some dishes and then try to go to bed. I hope I feel better tomorrow.",2

Needless to say I'm almost certainly not gonna get that job and it's a job that I've wanted for a while.

She told me a couple of tasks to accomplish for this week, which will help me ease out my thoughts.You know I'm kind of disappointed that it's not depression, because seriously I thought it is something which could be treated by medications or doctor involvement but it seems even more difficult now.

She told me that she wants to die this year because of how bad 2020 is going for her. I think it's all because of one friend that keeps framing her for things she didn't do such as vaping, stealing, and punching her which she didn't do. All the teachers know that girl is a liar and bad student though and know that my sister would never do those things. I'm worried for my sister and I know how much depression and thoughts of wanting to die everyday sucks. I don't want her to experience what I'm growing through. Maybe I'll surprise her with hot chocolate and food she likes tomorrow. Should I tell my therapist that my sister is having those thoughts? Maybe she could get some help and feel better but I'm also scared that she'll feel worse because of it. What should I do??  I'd appreciate some advice on what I can do to make her feel better.",2

I can't physically get myself out of bed some days and I've been home for two weeks. It feels like the work load just gets bigger and bigger and no matter how much I do there's still more.

I've gone to therapy for about 5 years for my social anxiety but I feel like my depression is getting worse. I guess I've just accepted the fact that I'll never have friends and will never be able to talk like a normal person. I don't even have people to talk to anymore. I usually end up talking to myself, as strange as it is. I can't even be myself around anyone either. I just feel like I'm never going to accomplish anything in life and might as well give up.

I care about them a lot. And I think that somehow they still care about me. They've said that the only reason they're still around is that they're afraid I'll hurt or kill myself if they're not there to stop me. I want to do what's best for them. Surely if I cut them out of my life, and avoid meeting new people, but I don't hurt myself, then they'll be happy and safe, and their fears will go unrealized.

2543,"Severe depression on weekends but not during week, at wit's end? Stealing all my joy. : Hi all.I'm 26, have a diagnosed mental disorder (I feel uncomfortable disclosing) and have been on medication for many years (mood stabilizers). I do not struggle with depression **in general** despite a very dysfunctional family that causes 99% of my stress. I cope very well in day to day life, even through the 3 weeks where my dad was close to dying in hospital this year. I have a very positive outlook and maintain a normal job which I am very successful at. I am also in a wonderful romantic relationship for 2 years and have a good friendship circle. All the boxes are ticked. But this is where things go wrong. On a weekend I find myself in such a black hole and specifically on Sundays. I can barely move on a Sunday. Yesterday I spent the entire day in a fog, I was unpleasant to be around, I could barely talk to my partner and I honestly just wanted to sleep. This is rinse and repeat every week for as long as I can remember. Now I know what you're thinking, is it my job? I can honestly say that is impossible because I am very happy at my job, it virtually has no stress components to me and during the week I am in SUCH a good, happy, upbeat positive mood. I don't dread going to work.  I don't worry about work ever. I leave work and don't think about it again or  have to.But bloody hell, Saturday rolls by and I often like death. Sunday comes and I am suicidal all over again.  I know Sunday blues is a thing and it has crossed my mind but I don't know how to cope or change this? I try and make plans for Sundays but no matter what I do, I feel exhausted, tired, drained, sad, depressed. I can have the best day planned will all my favorite things and still feel like crap. It sometimes is the same on a Saturday too. I wake up excited for the weekend and it is just... shit. But then during the week I'm so happy?It's starting to make me act very irritated towards my partner and I cannot figure out how to change this. I'm in good shape. I exercise a lot.

Despite working out daily, keeping up on my online schooling daily, journalling daily, there was a void that I could not seem to fill.

Well, this post its because i want to talk just a bit about my disease, and i would like to know if anyone in here have it and would like to chat. I have never in my whole life meet anyone with it before.Its called Neurofibromatosis, for those who donÂ´t know. ThereÂ´s 3 types. Type 1.Type 2. Scwannomatosis.The type 2 and the ""Scwannomatosis"" are the worsts. I have type 1. It kinda give you random symptons. With the type 1 you can; (and donÂ´t wanna offense anyone. but iÂ´m not good with english tbh. lol) Retarded, have myopia, have deformities, scoliosis, and others stuff. In my case i have some deformities (because of my surgerys) myopia iÂ´m not sure... bc i use glasses but i have never been told if its because of my disease. and i have scoliosis. I have been in surgery 2 times. The first one it was because i needed it. You know. But, after a while a dick-head hit me very hard and it got broken. So if i didnÂ´t get surgery again i wouldnÂ´t be able to walk again.iÂ´ve been growing up around people who donÂ´t understand it. (My family does and support me. So. Cool) But, meanwhile some kids grew up with football and beating the shit between them. I grew up with my SEGA, or my old PC, or my ps2. So... i donÂ´t complain. But i was kinda... different in school when i had to talk to them. Because i wasnÂ´t able to just talk about to games or something. Because they were more like sports and stuff. So, I grew up with no friends. Until high school. High school was the worst. Bullyng, being alone most of the time, in the recesses, doing homework alone, or anything of school alone. Until one day i meet some good people. Who liked memes, shitposts, games, and stuff. (I have a post talking about how it went... and it was bad) So yeah. It was kinda crap growing up with this. Idk what to say tbh. I just want to meet anyone else with it to talk. ###",2

I was on my computer as usual, playing some Fallout 4. And, I looked at my drawing stuff sitting basically unused on my desk so I stick on some music and try to draw something. After an hour of drawing something, rubbing it out, trying again, over and over I was getting too angry, I had to stop.. Throwing my stuff onto the floor I open up YouTube to watch something funny to get my mood up. Find a video, open it, click play. I get ""Ethernet doesn't have a valid Ip configuration"". Boom no Internet on my pc.So I spend the next hour trying every available solution I could find on my phone and nothing works.. And I can't just use WiFi because my USB dingle chose this time to break because when my stupid father was building this PC for me he said ""You don't need WiFi or Bluetooth relax""So I try to tether my phone to my pc, it won't work, so that's when I climb under my desk to see if the plug is broken, and it's fine. And that is the point where I started to cry,  crying my stupid eyes out until I couldn't cry no more. I did IT at college and I can't fix my own stupid computer. I can't draw, I can't play games because I'm just terrible at those and have to cheat, I can't sleep, I can't even lay down properly, can't get a job, can't go outside, why the heck am I even here when I can't even handle one of my many devices not connecting to the Internet.

Just wondering maybe we can share what we play and perhaps, just maybe find others to play with or something? Also do you actually enjoy gaming? For me, especially the past 6 years or so, it's been very hard to enjoy. I find that trying to finish a game just becomes a chore, and I always feel guilty in some way, for not doing something ""better"" with my time, and even though I find it hard to enjoy, I always somehow manage to trick myself into thinking that this time will be different. And then 30 minutes in, I'm probably already bored lol.  So if you relate, maybe you can at least mention what was the last game you enjoyed (and how long ago if you want).Anyway, last games I enjoyed were way back around this time last year, they were Titanfall 2 (campaign) and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. As of right now, I'm trying to get into Resident Evil 2 RE, played a bit of Halo: Anniversary on PC (I don't intend to finish just kinda revisiting some of it) and I tried my best to get through A Plague Tale: Innocence, but I just couldn't so I stopped. Then there's LoL which I started playing like 8 years ago, so it's one of those games I just kinda come back to here and there And last but not least, there's Magic the Gathering: Arena which is technically the most recent game I've enjoyed, which I started about a month ago...but it's just a card game so whatever I guess.Anyway, feel free to share and I hope you're all doing okay :)",2

2681,"Feeling useless and unwanted : The last couple years of my life have been horrible, I spent 2-3 years indoors with maybe all together 30 days outside in them 2-3 years, Ik you'll think 'why didn't u get a job' or 'go out and meet people' but there's a lot of reasons behind that, 1 because I recently moved from a place I had everything I wanted because of something that it's own post entirely, and I lost all my friends and the place I moved to I tried getting a job at a car wash and that did not last at all, so after I lost that job I completely felt utterly useless so I isolated myself even more, but recently I met someone, and this someone lives a couple hours from me but things started to get better, I'm on the verge of moving in with them and they've motivated me to find work, unfortunately that feeling of uselessness has gotten much much worse, I feel like if I say or do the wrong thing they'll go off me and the thought of that breaks my heart because I've never had anyone like this before, recently we found out we was expecting a child and unfortunately she had a miscarriage and it's completely broken us but none of us show it, I've tried talking about my feelings to her but it completely breaks me and I just can't hold in tears, she is also trying to stay strong but it's taking a major tole on her and since the miscarriage I've felt so depressed and useless Cus finally stuff was looking up and now I'm in constant fear that I'm going to lose this person and if that happened idk if I'd be able to go on any longer, Thank you for taking the time to read this I needed to get it off my chest",2
2682,"How do you cope when you've done something terrible, and find it difficult to live with yourself? : I've done terrible things, and I'm not sure I even deserve to live.",2
2683,Umm : I'm just really down right now. If someone wants to chat then that'd be cool,2
2684,"It was my birthday today : First birthday that I've felt depressed af, my birthday wish was to die in my sleep. I turned 19 and hopefully its my last birthday, I didn't really do anything either",2
2685,"Social Media Sucks. : Modern world sucks. I think that's pretty Fucking obvious. The internet has ruined everything. You're always subconsciously comparing yourself to everyone else online, it's hard to accept the fact that you're not the best looking, most skilled or the most talented person out there. Play guitar or cover song? Someone has already done it and 10x better than you. Have a new idea? Someone's already done it! Think you look nice today? You're not as attractive as 90% of the people you see. Simply impossible to compete or to even be noticed, much less appreciated. Because of this your self esteem is just raped but go to take a break from social media and all you're doing is isolating yourself. Everyone is so connected it's like we've all forgotten how to socialise in real life, at least I have I think. People would much rather text and stay home than to go out and play. It's like a super-internet culture has completely overridden all local cultures and communities. There is nothing unique about an individual's background anymore. We all act the same now on the internet that has us connected globally. Nobody seems to hold any inherent traditions or values. And all this fucking virtue signalling, why can't you fake bastards Fucking stop? Legit nobody fucking cares how virtuous you are, how altruistic you are, you're only making anti-racist, anti-homophobic posts to fuel your own narcissistic egos. Idk what I'm saying, go to hell",2
2686,"Have a few people but still alone : There are a few friends I talk to regularly but like, it's hard to explain. Ya know when you have people but you also can't tell them a lot of stuff about how you feel because it kinda involves them and you don't wanna lose them like you have others I'm the past? I just, I want those fantasy friendships, where people hug each other and play around and cuddle up to watch stuff but I only see other friends doing that and it fucking kills me. I have made up conversations and even arguments in my head and I feel like I'm losing it. Constantly paranoid about everything, worrying about every little detail and there's so much work right now, definitely don't sleep or eat enough, ik because that gets pointed out (not in a mean way) and I just don't know what to do anymore.. I've thought a lot about death and stuff like that but I don't think I'd ever be able to. I have no idea what to even do with my life, I just feel so lost and alone with so many regrets and I don't wanna be around anymore. At times I think that everyone is better off without me.",2
2687,"I'm doing better but the apathy is just unpleasant : I had a good time today as I went biking. Went out to eat with the family as well. I'm feeling tired right now and I can't bring myself to do anything, it's just not appealing... ugh",2
2688,Birthdays.. : I hit 18 today..I honestly thought I wouldn't see the number but here it is. Does anyone else just have a birthday and feel like wow I'm still here even though you figured you wouldn't have been?,2
2689,How to stop isolating myself socially when I feel like crap? : I tend to isolate myself from people when I start to feel like they don't care about me. I start feeling like crap and just want someone to care for me and be there. And I may continue this trend until someone messages me or I just realize that they just don't care why should I. Its also worse when I see them talking to others but not me and it just feels like a punch. Even if they have shown they cared like a week ago and haven't really talked to me or interactions have been negative since the caring I start to feel scared that they actually dislike me and hence i start isolation.How can I stop this?,2
2690,"She responded to me, but I still feel dead inside : I'm happy she at least responded, but I feel horrible for what I've done",2
2691,"Somethings are more beautiful in the dark : Been having a rough week, work has been stressful and I've been feeling very lonely. I find it hard to connect with ppl, seems like no one knows how to be a good friend anymore. And on that topic I want to say that everyone that has faced difficulties in life, weather it be through mental health of life circumstances has a bit of a darkness in their soul. And this darkness is a beautiful thing. I don't know if I'm just a bit fu*%*ed up but I find people who have not experienced pain and loss to be have less substance. Individuals who have had to pull themselves out of dark places have more character, more charm, more mystery. And in my experience these are the kind of people who are the most loyal in times of hardship.So although I know many of you are facing difficult time, and like myself struggle with depression; I want you to know that once you heal you may always feel that darkness, but darkness itself is beautiful.",2
2692,"I struggled to count to 20 today : For some context I work in mcdonalds and I was on the line finishing the stuff and almost every 20 box I think I sent was wrong. I just couldn't focus and do it quick and it was awful, and I ended up doing almost 2 hours of overtime because I can't say no to people.I fucking hate it, the worst part is I was an A grade maths student less than 5 years ago. Now I can't count to 20, I can't do basic maths without a calculator, I can barely focus at times. I feel like I'm just regressing as a person in every way but still aging, I just wanna end it all before it gets worse and I become a fucking amoeba of a person.",2
2693,"My First Yoga Class : My supervisor is a yoga instructor, so he invited me to attend one of his classes. He struggled with addiction for years, and claims that yoga helps him stay sober in addition to boosting his self confidence.I was hesitant at first, but I've been trying new things lately, and thought this would be a decent way to improve my presence of mind. I didn't underestimate the class, but damn did it kick my butt. I kept looking at other people to see how to properly execute various poses, even though I was told not to worry about what other people were doing. I was discouraged at my lack of experience, but confident in my strength and endurance, and that's something I haven't felt before. I think I'm getting the hang of self discipline, and being reliant is something I like about myself.",2
2694,"I Think my Mom is Depressed, What Should I do? : I think my mom is definitely depressed. The other day when I went to grab my charger from her room I saw post-it notes on her bedside table that had messages like ""everything will be ok"" and many more depressingly depressing notes. She was also almost crying the other day in the car for no reason. I think its because I haven't been trying in school as of recently. Also I have been upset because she's hiring like 6+ people to help me with various tasks that I don't need help with. 3 tutors, therapists, mindfulness person, planning person and much more. She's throwing so much money to help me with stuff I truly don't need help with. I think she thinks the more she throws at the situation the more I will care about school. She also sent me to live with my aunt and uncle for a few months. She was also upset because I snuck out to get vaccines since she's anti vax. I know she might be a little crazy but I still love her because she is my mom. Also a person I just don't like talking to. She's a single mom so all she has to talk to is me. She can be extremely argumentative. Her entire life she's gotten through because of the wealth of her parents and her immensely wealthy boyfriends. Every night tells me to go to bed and gives me a 45 minute warning, 30, etc. Watches over me like a hawk because it is literally all she has to do. I've never been able to get with a girl or hangout with new friends because I know she'll be watching me so close. Only time I was close to a girl we were hanging out after a dance at 1am and my mom had stayed awake for me. She threatened to come to her house if I did not come home immediately. The moment I can drive I plan on being home almost never because I don't like it. This will probably make her depression worse. What should I do?",2
